- [x] Cont Galerkin 
- [ ] ~Disc Galerkin~
- [ ] Semi-lagrangian
- [ ] Free-slip BC on surface

[[P](https://github.com/underworldcode/underworld3/blob/master/src/ex1.c#L73)] Physics
- [ ] Buoyancy driven convection
- [ ] Stokes-Boussinesq
- [ ] Temp-dep rheology
- [ ] Energy equation, resolve bdry layers

[[S](https://github.com/underworldcode/underworld3/blob/master/src/ex1.c#L354)] Solvers

- [ ] Semi-lagrangian
- [ ] ~TS~  (address this later)

PIC for composition
- [x] Viscosity, buoyancy, ... 
- [ ] Nearest neighbour (k-d tree ? ðŸŒ³ )
- [x] 2D - L2 projection into FEM space (Petsc shall provide)
- [ ] 3D - L2 projection into FEM space (Petsc shall provide but not in 3D)

**Tasks**

  - [ ] Investigate cython for functions
  - [ ] Petsc4py compatibility 
  - [ ] alias .data and .array
  - [ ] rejig a few models top down ... 
  - [ ] audit the petsc / petsc4py features corresponding to uw ones
  - [ ] Can we get early into TS (TS-lite)
