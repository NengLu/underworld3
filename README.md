# underworld3

## Documentation

The underworld documentation is in two parts: the user manual / theory manual is a jupyterbook that is built from this repository automatically from the sources in the `Jupyterbook` directory. The api documentation is also autogenerated.

- https://underworldcode.github.io/underworld3/main/FrontPage.html
- https://underworldcode.github.io/underworld3/main_api/index.html

The development branch has similar documentation:

- https://underworldcode.github.io/underworld3/development/FrontPage.html
- https://underworldcode.github.io/underworld3/development_api/index.html


## Building

Refer to the Dockerfile for uw3 build instructions.  

For development, building inplace will probably be preferable.  Remove
any existing installations using `clean.sh` then run

```shell
python3 setup.py develop 
```

The in-place `pip` installation may be helpful for developers (after the above)

```shell
pip install -e .
```

For in place usage, you will usually need to set an appropriate PYTHONPATH to 
include the underworld build directory.
