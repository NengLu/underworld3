Welcome to `Underworld3`, a mathematically self-describing, finite-element code for geodynamic modelling. This quick-start guide has basic installation instructions and a brief introduction to some of the concepts in the `Underworld3` code.

## Installation Guide

The quickest option is **not to install** anything but click on the rocket icon (top right) to launch our notebook examples on mybinder.org. If do you want to install the code on your own machine, we recommend using `miniconda` and `mamba` and to create a separate virtual environment and to install the code from source.

More details in the [Installation Instructions](Installation.qmd)

## Notebooks

Underworld is designed to be run in the jupyter notebook environment where you can take advantage of jupyter's rich display capabilities to explore the mathematics of your problem, visualise results and query classes or live objects.

It's a good first step after you install the code to look at the [examples notebooks](Notebooks/Notebook_Index.ipynb). When you are happy that things are working OK, you can move along to look at the full documentation or the benchmarking repository.

**Summary of skills that the notebooks cover**



## Next Steps



Some of the cool things about UW3 that you can do with a bit of effort (at the moment)

  - gmsh (anything - Pramoda's work)
  - deformed meshes, interesting boundary conditions
  - free surfaces, relaxation etc
