Welcome to `Underworld3`, a mathematically self-describing, finite-element code for geodynamic modelling. This quick-start guide has basic installation instructions and a brief introduction to some of the concepts in the `Underworld3` code.

It's a good first step after you install the code to look at the notebooks. When you are happy that things are working OK, you can move along to look at the full documentation or the benchmarking repository.

## Notebooks

Notebook 1 - [Meshes](Notebooks/1-Meshes.html): Introduces the mesh discretisation that we use in `Underworld3` and how you can build one of the pre-defined meshes. This notebook also show you how to use the `pyvista` visualisation tools for `Underworld3` objects. The mesh holds information on the mesh geometry, boundaries and coordinate systems.

Notebook 2 - [Variables](Notebooks/2-Variables.html): Introduces the concept of `meshVariables` in `Underworld3`. These are both data containers and `sympy` symbolic objects. We show you how to inspect a `meshVariable`, set the data values in the `meshVariable` and visualise them.

Notebook 3 - [Symbols](Notebooks/3-Symbolic_Forms.html): `meshVariables` are `sympy` objects
that can be composed with other symbolic objects and evaluated numerically when required. They can also be differentiated. Most importantly, `sympy` can manipulate expressions, simplify them and cancel terms.

Notebook 4 - [Diffusion Solver](Notebooks/4-Solvers.html): Introduces the various solver templates that are available in Underworld, starting with a steady-state diffusion problem. The template requires you to set some constitutive properties and define the unknowns. These are handled through subsitution into symbolic forms and the template equation can be inspected before you need to supply concrete expressions.

Notebook 5 - [Stokes Solver](Notebooks/5-Solvers.html): Stokes equation is a more complicated system of equations to solve. This complexity is mostly hidden when you set the problem up. There are some interesting ways to constrain boundary values which are demonstrated using an annulus mesh (curved, free-slip boundaries) and a $\delta$ function buoyancy source.

Notebook 6 - [Timestepping](Notebooks/6-Timestepping.html): *Coupled* Stokes flow plus thermal advection-diffusion gives a simple convection solver. The timestepping loop is written by hand because usually you will want to do some analysis or output some checkpoints.

Notebook 7 - Unsteady flow   Using a passive swarm to track flow - Navier Stokes in a pipe with fixed side walls

Notebook 8 - Swarm variables - exploring how they work



## Next Steps

Some of the cool things about UW3 that you can do with a bit of effort (at the moment)

  - gmsh (anything - Pramoda's work)
  - deformed meshes, interesting boundary conditions
  - free surfaces, relaxation etc
