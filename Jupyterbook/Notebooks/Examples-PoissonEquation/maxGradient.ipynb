    "When solving a physical system, sometimes we want to recover other properties of the system that are derivatives of the variable we are solving for. For example, in a steady state heat conduction problem modelled by the poisson equation $\\nabla^2 T = 0$ where $T$ is the temperature, we might want to find the flux of heat $-k \\nabla T$, where $k$ is the coeffecient of heat conductivity. In underworld this is done using projections."
