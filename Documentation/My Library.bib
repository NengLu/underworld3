  abstract = {The use of time-lapse data, or 4D seismic, in conjunction with production data in computer aided history matching of reservoir models requires that the various types of data are incorporated in a single objective function measuring the mismatch between the simulated and measured data. In the context of linear maximum likelihood estimation, the contribution of seismic data and production data to the objective function can be balanced on the basis of the sum of the inverse of the data and model error covariance matrices. Methods to estimate these covariance matrices for the combined set of production data and seismic impedance are presented. Generally, the seismic data will be correlated leading to a nondiagonal error covariance matrix. This matrix will also be very large, and efficient methods to invert this matrix are required. This is done using a very fast discrete convolution inverse based on multiplication of block Toeplitz matrices. It is shown that the regression may converge to a wrong solution if incorrect values for the data correlations are used.},

  abstract = {An understanding of the formation of new continental crust provides an important guide to locating the oldest terrestrial rocks and minerals. We evaluated the crustal thicknesses of the thinnest stable continental crust and of an unsubductable oceanic plateau and used the resulting data to estimate the amount of mantle melting which produces permanent continental crust. The lithospheric mantle is sufficiently depleted to produce permanent buoyancy (i.e., the crust is unsubductable) at crustal thicknesses greater than 25-27 km. These unsubductable oceanic plateaus and hotspot island chains are important sources of new continental crust. The newest continental crust (e.g., the Ontong Java plateau) has a basaltic composition, not a granitic one. The observed structure and geochemistry of continents are the result of convergent margin magmatism and metamorphism which modify the nascent basaltic crust into a lowermost basaltic layer overlain by a more silicic upper crust. The definition of a continent should imply only that the lithosphere is unsubductable over {\textbackslash}textgreater or =0.25 Ga time periods. Therefore, the search for the oldest crustal rocks should include rocks from lower to mid-crustal levels.},

The estimated uncertainty of the ETC measurements is 2\%. The porosity of the sample was 13\%. A rapid increase of ETC was found for dry sandstone at low pressures between 0.1 and 100 MPa along various isotherms. At high-pressure range (P{\textbackslash}textgreater100 MPa) a weak linear dependence of the ETC with pressure was observed. The pressure effect is negligibly small after first 80-100 MPa where bridging of microcracks or improvement of grain contacts takes place. We interpreted the measured ETC data using a various theoretical and semi-empirical models in order to check their accuracy and predictive capability. The effect of structure (size, shape, and distribution of the pores), porosity, and mineralogical composition on temperature and pressure dependences of the ETC of sandstone was discussed. To estimate the effect of temperature and pressure on the ETC of sandstone the pressure, beta (sub P) , and temperature, beta (sub T) , coefficients of ETC were calculated from the measured values of ETC. The measured values of the ETC were also used to calculate the values of the isothermal compressibility, chi (sub T) , and thermal expansion coefficient, alpha .

  abstract = {Earthquake seismograms recorded by instruments in deep boreholes have low levels of background noise and wide signal bandwidth. They have been used to extend our knowledge of crustal attenuation both in the near-surface and at seismogenic depths. Site effects are of major importance to seismic hazard estimation, and the comparison of surface, shallow and deep recordings allows direct determination of the attenuation in the near-surface. All studies to date have found that Q is very low in the near-surface ( 10 in the upper 100 m), and increases rapidly with depth. Unlike site amplification, attenuation at shallow depths exhibits little dependence on rock-type. These observations are consistent with the opening of fractures under decreasing lithostatic pressure being the principal cause of the severe near-surface attenuation. Seismograms recorded in deep boreholes are relatively unaffected by near-sur- face effects, and thus can be used to measure crustal attenuation to higher frequencies (]100 Hz) than surface recordings. Studies using both direct and coda waves recorded at over 2 km depth find Q to be high ( 1000) at seismogenic depths in California, increasing only weakly with frequency between 10 and 100 Hz. Intrinsic attenuation appears to be the dominant mechanism. These observations contrast with those of the rapidly increasing Q with frequency determined from surface studies in the frequency range 1 to 10 Hz. Further work is necessary to constrain the factors responsible for this apparent change in the frequency dependence of Q, but it is clearly unwise to extrapolate Q estimates made below about 10 Hz to higher frequencies.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY We present a new global model for the Earth's lithosphere and upper mantle (LithoRef18) obtained through a formal joint inversion of 3-D gravity anomalies, geoid height, satellite-derived gravity gradients and absolute elevation complemented with seismic, thermal and petrological prior information. The model includes crustal thickness, average crustal density, lithospheric thickness, depth-dependent density of the lithospheric mantle, lithospheric geotherms, and average density of the sublithospheric mantle down to 410 km depth with a surface discretization of 2{$^\circ$} {\texttimes} 2{$^\circ$}. Our results for lithospheric thickness and sublithospheric density structure are in excellent agreement with estimates from recent seismic tomography models. A comparison with higher resolution regional studies in a number of regions around the world indicates that our values of crustal thickness and density are an improvement over a number of previous global crustal models. Given the strong similarity with recent tomography models down to 410 km depth, LithoRef18 can be readily merged with these seismic models to include seismic velocities as part of the reference model. We include several analyses of robustness and reliability of input data, method and results. We also provide easy-to-use codes to interrogate the model and use its predictions for the development of higher-resolution models. Considering the model{\texteuro} s features and data fitting statistics, LithoRef18 will be useful in a wide range of geophysical and geochemical applications by serving as a reference or initial lithospheric model for (i) higher-resolution gravity, seismological and/or integrated geophysical studies of the lithosphere and upper mantle, (ii) including far-field effects in gravity-based regional studies, (iii) global circulation/convection models that link the lithosphere with the deep Earth, (iv) estimating residual, static and dynamic topography, (v) thermal modelling of sedimentary basins and (vi) studying the links between the lithosphere and the deep Earth, among others. Several avenues for improving the reliability of LithoRef18's predictions are also discussed. Finally, the inversion methodology presented in this work can be applied in other planets for which potential field data sets are either the only or major constraints to their internal structures (e.g. Moon, Venus, etc.).},

  abstract = {A combined geophysical-petrological methodology to study the thermal, compositional, density, and seismological structure of lithospheric/sublithospheric domains is presented. A new finite-element code (LitMod) is used to produce 2-D forward models from the surface to the 410-km discontinuity. The code combines data from petrology, mineral physics, and geophysical observables within a self-consistent framework. The final result is a lithospheric/sublithospheric model that simultaneously fits all geophysical observables and consequently reduces the uncertainties associated with the modeling of these observables alone or in pairs, as is commonly done. The method is illustrated by applying it to both oceanic and continental domains. We show that anelastic attenuation and uncertainties in seismic data make it unfeasible to identify compositional variations in the lithospheric mantle from seismic studies only. In the case of oceanic lithosphere, plates with thermal thicknesses of 105 {\textpm} 5 km satisfy geophysical and petrological constraints. We find that Vp are more sensitive to phase transitions than Vs, particularly in the case of the spinel-garnet transition. A low-velocity zone with absolute velocities and gradients comparable to those observed below ocean basins is an invariable output of our oceanic models, even when no melt effects are included. In the case of the Archean subcontinental lithospheric mantle, we show that ``typical'' depleted compositions (and their spatial distribution) previously thought to be representative of these mantle sections are compatible neither with geophysical nor with petrological data. A cratonic keel model consisting of (1) strongly depleted material (i.e., dunitic/harzburgitic) in the first 100--160 km depth and (2) less depleted (approximately isopycnic) lower section extending down to 220--300 km depth is necessary to satisfy elevation, geoid, SHF, seismic velocities, and petrological constraints. This highly depleted (viscous) upper layer, and its chemical isolation, may play a key role in the longevity and stability of cratons.},

  abstract = {The elastic properties and the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of the lithospheric mantle are important parameters that affect the results of lithospheric modelling. However, there is still no consensus on which values are the most appropriate to model the lithosphere, and various average values are used for lithospheres of different age, thermal state, and composition. We present an integrated approach to calculate the elastic properties and the CTE of mantle rocks, based on the mineral physics of composites and considering the spatial heterogeneity of the lithospheric mantle. The method considers the dependence of parameters on pressure and temperature, following a procedure based on an extension of the shear-lag model and thermal expansivity systematics. Representative values are calculated for three lithospheric domains: (a) Archean lithosphere, (b) Phanerozoic continental lithosphere, and (c) oceanic lithosphere. For the case of Archean lithosphere, values of CTE between (3.04 and 3.11) {\texttimes} 10-5 K-1 are found to be suitable for modelling, and a constant depth-derivative for P-waves {$\partial$}Vp/{$\partial$}z {$\sim$} 2.30 {\texttimes} 10-3 s-1 is estimated. Results for Phanerozoic lithosphere show that no single average value of CTE can be used in modelling. Values range non-linearly between (3.25 and 3.47) {\texttimes}10-5 K-1 at pressures equivalent to depths of 25 and 100 km, respectively. The P-wave velocity variation with depth exhibits a decrease in the range of 25-40 km, followed by almost a constant value of {$\sim$}8.08 km s-1 between 40 and 60 km, and a systematic increase with a depth-derivative {$\partial$}Vp/{$\partial$}z {$\sim$} 1.12 {\texttimes} 10-3 s-1 from 60 km downwards. The variation in the CTE is largest in oceanic lithosphere. In young plates ({$\lessequivlnt$}20 Ma), values of the CTE range non-linearly from (3.25 to 3.82) {\texttimes} 10-5 K-1 at pressures equivalent to depths of 10 and 50 km, respectively. In old oceanic lithosphere ({$\sim$}100 Ma), the CTE is slightly smaller, showing values in the range of (3.0-3.7) {\texttimes} 10-5 K-1 at 10 and 80 km, respectively, giving a typical average value of {$\sim$}3.45 {\texttimes} 10-5 K-1. P-wave velocity in young oceanic lithosphere decreases from {$\sim$}8.14 to 8.0 km s-1 in the first 30 km, then follows a nearly constant path downwards. In old oceanic lithosphere, on the other hand, a systematic reduction from {$\sim$}8.2 to 8.1 km s-1 in P-wave velocities is predicted as depth increases from 10 to 80 km. The effects of heterogeneities in CTE and elastic parameters are partic ularly noticeable in Archean lithosphere, where difference in predicted elevations and geoid heights can reach values of {$\geq$}300 and {$\sim$}6 m, respectively, when compared to standard models. These effects are less ({$\lessequivlnt$}40 and 0.25 m, respectively) in Phanerozoic continental and oceanic lithospheres. Uncertainties in experimental data and geotherms indicate that compositional effects cannot be completely resolved by seismic tomography in regions with P-wave and S-wave anomalies {$\lessequivlnt\pm$}1.5 and {\textpm}3\%, respectively. {\copyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Temperature (anharmonic and anelastic), pressure and compositional derivatives for all these parameters are evaluated. The results show that the widely used correlations between Vp/Vs and Mg\# in peridotites are strictly valid only for garnet-bearing assemblages at temperatures {\textbackslash}textless900{$^\circ$}C. The correlation breaks down when: i) spinel is the stable Al-rich phase in the assemblage and ii) when anelastic attenuation of seismic velocities becomes important (T{$\greaterequivlnt$}900{$^\circ$}C). This implies that the range of applicability of published Vp/Vs--Mg\# correlations for the upper mantle is limited to a depth interval between the spinel--garnet phase transition and the 900{$^\circ$}C isotherm. We use numerical simulations to show that this depth interval is virtually nonexistent in lithospheres thinner than {$\sim$}140km and can comprise up to {$\sim$}50\% of the lithospheric mantle in thick ({\textbackslash}textgreater220km) lithospheric domains. In addition, we show that for most of the upper mantle the expected {$\Delta$}(Vp/Vs) values associated with compositional variations are smaller than the resolution limit of current seismological methods. All these considerations suggest that the Vp/Vs ratio is not a reliable measure of compositional variations and that for large parts of the upper mantle compositional anomalies cannot be separated from thermal anomalies on the basis of seismological studies only. We further confirm that the only reliable indicator of compositional anomalies in a peridotitic mantle is the ratio of density to shear wave velocities ({$\rho$}/Vs). Our results demonstrate that geophysical--petrological models (forward or inverse) that model these two fields (i.e. density and Vs) self-consistently within a robust thermodynamic framework are necessary for characterizing the small-scale thermal and compositional structure of the lithosphere and sublithospheric upper mantle.},

The post-irradiation annealing (PIA) caused the growth of the Ti-rich clusters with a stronger effect at 700 {$^\circ$}C than at 600 {$^\circ$}C. The irradiation caused elemental segregations at the grain boundary and the grain interior, and the grain boundary segregation behavior is consistent with observations in other irradiated austenitic steels.

  abstract = {Short- and long-term processes at or close to the subduction plate interface (e.g.,mineral transformations, fluid release, seismicity and more generally deformation) might be more closely related than previously thought. Increasing evidence from the fossil rock record suggests that some episodes of their long geological evolution match or are close to timescales of the seismic cycle. This contribution uses rocks recovered (episodically) from subduction zones, together with insights from thermomechanical modelling, to provide a new dynamic vision of the nature, structure and properties of the plate interface and to bridge the gap between the mechanical behavior of active subduction zones (e.g.,coupling inferred from geophysical monitoring) and fossil ones (e.g.,coupling required to detach and recover subducted slab fragments). Based on critical observations and an exhaustive compilation of worldwide subducted oceanic units (for which the presence near the plate interface, rock types, pressure, temperature, T/P gradients, thickness and timing of detachment can be assessed), the present study demonstrates how long-term mechanical coupling exerts a key control on detachment from the slab and potential rock recovery. Critical assessment of rock T/P characteristics indicates that these fragments can indeed be used as natural probes and provide reliable information on subduction interface dynamics down to {\textasciitilde}2.8\,GPa. Rock clusters are identified at depths of 30, 55--60 and 80\,km, with some differences between rock types. Data also reveal a first-order evolution with subduction cooling (in the first {\textasciitilde}5\,Myr), which is interpreted as reflecting a systematic trend from strong to weak mechanical coupling, after which subduction is lubricated and mostly inhibits rock recovery. This contribution places bounds on the plate interface constitution, regular thickness ({$<$}300\,m; i.e. where/when there is no detachment), changing geometry and effective viscosity. The concept of `coupled thickness' is used here to capture subduction interface dynamics, notably during episodes of strong mechanical coupling, and to link long- and short-term deformation. Mechanical coupling depends on mantle wedge rheology, viscosity contrasts and initial structures (e.g.,heterogeneous lithosphere, existence of d{\'e}collement horizons, extent of hydration, asperities) but also on boundary conditions (convergence rates, kinematics), and therefore differs for warm and cold subduction settings. Although most present-day subduction zone segments (both along strike and downdip) are likely below the detachment threshold, we propose that the most favorable location for detachment corresponds to the spatial transition between coupled and decoupled areas. Effective strain localization involves dissolution-precipitation and dislocation creep but also possibly brittle fractures and earthquakes, even at intermediate depths.},

  abstract = {Traditionally, 1D models based on scaling laws have been used to parameterized convective heat transfer rocks in the interior of terrestrial planets like Earth, Mars, Mercury and Venus to tackle the computational bottleneck of high-fidelity forward runs in 2D or 3D. However, these are limited in the amount of physics they can model (e.g. depth dependent material properties) and predict only mean quantities such as the mean mantle temperature. We recently showed that feedforward neural networks (FNN) trained using a large number of 2D simulations can overcome this limitation and reliably predict the evolution of entire 1D laterally-averaged temperature profile in time for complex models [Agarwal et al. 2020]. We now extend that approach to predict the full 2D temperature field, which contains more information in the form of convection structures such as hot plumes and cold downwellings. Using a dataset of 10,525 two-dimensional simulations of the thermal evolution of the mantle of a Mars-like planet, we show that deep learning techniques can produce reliable parameterized surrogates (i.e. surrogates that predict state variables such as temperature based only on parameters) of the underlying partial differential equations. We first use convolutional autoencoders to compress the temperature fields by a factor of 142 and then use FNN and long-short term memory networks (LSTM) to predict the compressed fields. On average, the FNN predictions are 99.30\% and the LSTM predictions are 99.22\% accurate with respect to unseen simulations. Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) of the LSTM and FNN predictions shows that despite a lower mean absolute relative accuracy, LSTMs capture the flow dynamics better than FNNs. When summed, the POD coefficients from FNN predictions and from LSTM predictions amount to 96.51\% and 97.66\% relative to the coefficients of the original simulations, respectively.},

  abstract = {In general, seismic methods provide a reliable way to image the crust--mantle interface, which is marked by a rapid increase in seismic velocity (theMoho). However, the coverage provided by seismic networks is necessar- ily limited due to access difficulties, and the cost and labour involved in collecting data. Gravity data provide an alternativeway tomodel the depth to theMoho, and providemore consistent and broader coverage.Wediscuss the usefulness of gravity data to model Moho depth, and the advantages and disadvantages of several gravity modelling methods. As an example, a model of Australia's Moho is generated through seismically constrained gravity inversion, including an estimate ofmodelling uncertainty. The inversion results demonstrate that gravity inversion is generally useful, but that its usefulness is subject to the following limitations: 1 --- gravity inversion cannot spontaneously generate thick, high-density crust, nor thin, low-density crust, and, unless constrained, will not generate a correctMohowhere such crust exists. 2---major errors in the definition of the a-priori density structure, in particular features that are fixed during inversion, will influence theMoho results. 3 --- applying a broadrange of inversionparameters is necessary to characterise uncertainty.Model variabilitymaps forAustralia showthat the average error is less than 5 km. There is a general relationship with seismic coverage, but the areas of highest uncertainty are not necessarily thosewith the lowest seismic estimate density. Comparison with pre- vious seismic, and seismic-gravitymodels of Australia'sMoho indicates that lowseismic data density limits use- fulness due to higher uncertainty in the gravity inversion. High-seismic data density also limits usefulness because Moho depth is largely known, and there is little scope for change. The usefulness of gravity inversion is maximumunder conditions where seismic coverage is moderately dense, but estimates are well distributed.},

  abstract = {A long-period magnetotelluric (MT) survey, with 39 sites covering an area of 270 by 150 km, has identified melt within the thinned lithosphere of Pleistocene-Holocene Newer Volcanics Province (NVP) in southeast Australia, which has been variously attributed to mantle plume activity or edge-driven mantle convection. Two-dimensional inversions from the MT array imaged a low-resistivity anomaly (10--30 {\textohm} m) beneath the NVP at 40--80 km depth, which is consistent with the presence of 1.5--4\% partial melt in the lithosphere, but inconsistent with elevated iron content, metasomatism products or a hot spot. The conductive zone is located within thin juvenile oceanic mantle lithosphere, which was accreted onto thicker Proterozoic continental mantle lithosphere. We propose that the NVP owes its origin to decompression melting within the asthenosphere, promoted by lithospheric thickness variations in conjunction with rapid shear, where asthenospheric material is drawn by shear flow at a ``step'' at the base of the lithosphere.},

Both oven-dried and pre-fired specimens wrapped in Ni-Fe foil within the ( poorly) vented assembly were recovered essentially dry after 50-100 h of annealing at 1300 degrees C followed by slow staged cooling. The results for those specimens indicate broadly similar absorption-band viscoelastic behaviour, but with systematic differences in the frequency dependence of strain-energy dissipation Q(-1), attributed to differences in the small volume fraction of silicate melt and its spatial distribution. In contrast, it has been demonstrated that a new assembly involving a welded Pt capsule retains aqueous fluid during prolonged exposure to high temperatures allowing the first high-temperature torsional forced-oscillation measurements under high aqueous fluid pore pressure P-f. At temperatures{\textbackslash}textgreater1000 degrees C, a marked reduction in shear modulus, without concomitant increase in Q(-1), is attributed to the widespread wetting of grain boundaries resulting from grain-scale hydrofracturing and the maintenance of conditions of low differential pressure P-d=P-c-P-f. Staged cooling from 1000 degrees C is accompanied by decreasing Pf and progressive restoration of significantly positive differential pressure resulting in a microstructural regime in which the fluid on grain boundaries is increasingly restricted to arrays of pores. The more pronounced viscoelastic behaviour observed within this regime for the Pt-encapsulated specimen compared with the essentially dry specimens may reflect both water-enhanced solid-state relaxation and the direct influence of the fluid phase. The scenario of overpressurized fluids and hydrofracturing in the Pt-encapsulated dunite specimen may have some relevance to the high Q(-1) and low-velocity zones observed in subduction-zone environments. The outcomes of this exploratory study indicate that the presence of water can have a significant effect on the seismic wave attenuation in the upper mantle and provide the foundation for more detailed studies on the role of water.},

  abstract = {The Curie point depth is of great importance in characterizing geothermal resources. In this study, the Curie iso-depth map was provided using the well-known method of dividing the aeromagnetic dataset into overlapping blocks and analyzing the power spectral density of each block separately. Determining the optimum block dimension is vital in improving the resolution and accuracy of estimating Curie point depth. To investigate the relation between the optimal block size and power spectral density, a forward magnetic modeling was implemented on an artificial prismatic body with specified characteristics. The top, centroid, and bottom depths of the body were estimated by the spectral analysis method for different block dimensions. The result showed that the optimal block size could be considered as the smallest possible block size whose corresponding power spectrum represents an absolute maximum in small wavenumbers. The Curie depth map of the Sabalan geothermal field and its surrounding areas, in the northwestern Iran, was produced using a grid of 37 blocks with different dimensions from 10 {\texttimes} 10 to 50 {\texttimes} 50 km2, which showed at least 50\% overlapping with adjacent blocks. The Curie point depth was estimated in the range of 5 to 21 km. The promising areas with the Curie point depths less than 8.5 km are located around Mountain Sabalan encompassing more than 90\% of known geothermal resources in the study area. Moreover, the Curie point depth estimated by the improved spectral analysis is in good agreement with the depth calculated from the thermal gradient data measured in one of the exploratory wells in the region.},

  abstract = {The Iceland plume has played an influential role in the evolution of the North Atlantic Ocean and margins over the past 60 m.y. It is believed that this plume formed at the conjunction of a tetrad of hot, subvertical, convective sheets. The impingement of these hot sheets at the base of the lithospheric lid caused decompressional melting, generating substantial quantities of high-temperature magma that were injected into the cold overlying lid. Over the next 10 m.y., these sheets partly coalesced to form a crudely axisymmetric plume head. Here we analyze the lithospheric fingerprint of one of these hot convective sheets. By forward and inverse modeling of densely sampled wide-angle seismic data, in conjunction with gravity observations, we determined the three-dimensional shape of magmatic underplating trapped within the lithosphere. The injection of this melt into the lithosphere generated substantial permanent and minor transient uplift of Earth's surface. Predicted and measured amounts of consequent denudation and sedimentation agree within error. Temporal variations in the patterns of deposition and oceanic circulation adjacent to the convective sheet show its evolution through time and space. Our results suggest that this linear sheet has probably been directly and indirectly responsible for cyclical events over 60 m.y. These events have 0.5--1 and 4--6 m.y. periodicities, the existence of which may help to elucidate the dynamic behavior of convective sheets during and after impingement. Thus, in particular circumstances, surficial geological processes yield an indirect record of mantle convection and melt-generation processes.},

  abstract = {We summarize the uptake of carbon and sulfur during serpentinization of seafloor peridotites, and discuss the fate of these volatiles during subduction of serpentinite. We use a simplified classification to divide seafloor serpentinization into high-temperature and low-temperature processes. High-temperature serpentinization typically involves heat and mass transfer from gabbro intrusions, leading to addition of hydrothermal sulfide sulfur (up to {\textbackslash}textgreater1wt.\%) having high {$\delta$}34S values (+5 to +10‚Ä∞). Total carbon contents of bulk rocks are elevated (0.008-0.603wt.\%) compared to mantle values and {$\delta$}13CTotal C values of -3‚Ä∞ to -17.5‚Ä∞ result from mixtures of organic carbon and seawater-derived carbonate. Low-temperature serpentinization is generally characterized by microbial reduction of seawater sulfate, which leads to addition of sulfide sulfur (up to 1.4wt.\%) having negative {$\delta$}34S values (down to -45‚Ä∞), although local closed-system conditions can lead to reservoir effects and positive {$\delta$}34S values (up to +27‚Ä∞). Extensive circulation of cold seawater can cause oxidation, loss of sulfide, and addition of seawater sulfate resulting in high {$\delta$}34STotal-S values. High total carbon contents (0.006-7.2wt.\%) and {$\delta$}13C values of -26 to +2.2‚Ä∞ result from addition of variable proportions of organic carbon and seawater-derived carbonate to serpentinite. We estimate that serpentinization at mid ocean ridges is a sink for 0.35-0.64{\texttimes}1011molCy-1 and 0.13-1.46{\texttimes}1011molSy-1, comparable to the sinks of these elements per unit volume of mafic oceanic crust. Serpentinization in the subducting plate at subduction zones may further affect chemical budgets for serpentinization.During subduction metamorphism, sulfur and carbon contents remain unaffected by recrystallization of seafloor lizardite and chrysotile to antigorite, and formation of minor olivine. Dehydration of antigorite-serpentinites to chlorite-harzburgites at higher pressure and temperature results in loss of 5wt.\% water, and an average of 260ppm sulfur is lost as sulfate having {$\delta$}34S=14.5‚Ä∞, whereas carbon is unaffected. These volatiles can induce melting and contribute to 34S enrichments and oxidation of the sub-arc mantle wedge. Serpentinized oceanic peridotites carry isotopically fractionated water, carbon and sulfur into subduction zones. Up to 0.49{\texttimes}1011molsulfury-1 and 1.7{\texttimes}1011molcarbony-1 are subducted in serpentinites, less than 3\% of the total subduction budgets for each of these elements. Isotopically fractionated carbon, sulfur, and water remain in serpentinite dehydration products, however, and can be recycled deeper into the mantle where they may be significant for volatile budgets of the deep Earth. {\copyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {The discharge of nitrate-containing fresh groundwater from a sandy coastal aquifer and into the adjacent shallow marine environment was investigated near Esbjerg at the northern end of the Wadden Sea in Denmark. The geological structure of the coastal site was determined from drilling data and geoelectrical methods such as multi-electrode profiling (MEP). The distribution of shoreface sediment containing freshwater was mapped using MEP, underwater multi-electrode profiling (UMEP) and the electrical conductivity measured on pore waters. Freshwater discharge fluxes were measured using seepage meters and estimated from observed head gradients and measured hydraulic conductivities in the aquifer sediments. The nitrate distribution in the coastal sediments was obtained from water samples. A groundwater flow model was established to quantify the groundwater flow and travel times, and the distribution of freshwater discharge along the coastline. Results show that on the watershed scale the fresh groundwater discharge is controlled by sand filled buried channels that connect the aquifer with the shoreface sediments. The freshwater discharge along the coastline is at this scale probably best estimated by the groundwater flow model. However, at a more detailed scale the distribution of freshwater discharge in the intertidal zone is controlled by small scale geological heterogeneity and models are unable to predict what happens at a small scale on the beach and offshore. For that purpose UMEP, seepage meters, pore water sampling and local hydraulic gradients are more useful. These measurements indicate that the freshwater discharge occurs in distinct zones and that the highest discharge is near the high tide line, decreasing rapidly in a seaward direction. Nitrate is abundant in the shallow groundwater of the coastal aquifer and is also present in the discharging fresh groundwater at certain patches along the coast. However, on average very little nitrate is observed in the freshwater discharging at the coast. The maximum travel time of groundwater through the aquifer until it discharges at the coast is 100 years and since nitrate leaching from soils has only taken place during the last 40-50 years, part of the fresh groundwater discharging at the coast must be free of nitrate. {\copyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Temperature measurements can be analyzed for recharge and discharge rates, the effects of surface warming, interchange with surface water, hydraulic conductivity of streambed sediments, and basin-scale permeability. Temperature data are also used in formal solutions of the inverse problem to estimate ground water flow and hydraulic conductivity. The fundamentals of using heat as a ground water tracer were published in the 1960s, but recent work has significantly expanded the application to a variety of hydrogeological settings. In recent work, temperature is used to delineate flows in the hyporheic zone, estimate submarine ground water discharge and depth to the salt-water interface, and in parameter estimation with coupled ground water and heat-flow models. While short reviews of selected work on heat as a ground water tracer can be found in a number of research papers, there is no critical synthesis of the larger body of work found in the hydrogeological literature. The purpose of this review paper is to fill that void and to show that ground water temperature data and associated analytical tools are currently underused and have not yet realized their full potential.

  abstract = {The origin of midplate and along-ridge melting anomalies is controversial. Hy- potheses involve, at one extreme, concentrated hot mantle upwellings from the deep- est mantle and, at the other extreme, shallow processes dominated by stress, plate tectonics, and fertility variations, along with an asthenosphere that is near the melt- ing point. An updated hotspot list is presented and is tested against criteria relevant to both the deep thermal plume and the shallow (plate and asthenosphere) hypothe- ses. The unique polling approach of Courtillot et al. (2003) is applied to the plume hypothesis and to other hypotheses for melting anomalies. Although some ``primary'' (i.e., potentially deep-seated) hotspots (Iceland, Hawaii, Easter, Louisville, Afar, R{\'e}- union, and Tristan) score well using the chosen subjective plume criteria, they score poorly using criteria more appropriate to deep or thermal processes, such as magma temperature, heatflow, transition zone thickness, and high-resolution upper and lower mantle seismic tomographic results. In particular, Iceland, Easter,Afar, Tristan, and Yellowstone have not been confirmed by tomography. They are shallow features with well-defined plate tectonic explanations. For most melting anomalies (aka ``hotspots'') the plume hypothesis scores poorly against competing hypotheses such as stress- and crack-controlled magmatism, mechanisms that are associated with plate tectonics. Based on the results, most ``hotspots,'' including proposed ``primary'' or plume- candidate hotspots, are unlikely to be caused by thermal plumes from deep thermal boundary layers. Melting anomalies, on- or off-ridge, appear to be a natural result of nonrigid plate tectonics, including recycling, and do not require an extraordinary ex- planation, such as narrow thermal instabilities that traverse the whole mantle. Thus plate tectonics, plate boundaries, global plate reorganization, normal magmatism, melting anomalies, volcanic chains, and mantle geochemistry can be unified into a single theory.},

  abstract = {Field observations and geophysical data indicate that many igneous bodies grow by amalgamation of successive magma pulses that commonly take the shape of horizontal sheets (sills). Emplacement styles and emplacement rates of magma bodies have fundamental implications on magma differentiation, country rock metamorphism and assimilation, and for the formation of large magma chambers in the upper crust. When a magma body begins to grow by slow accretion of sills, each successive intrusion solidifies before the injection of the next one. When the system is thermally mature, sill temperatures equilibrate above the solidus, melts accumulate and older sills can re-melt. The time needed for each magma injection to cool down and equilibrate with its surrounding is short relatively to the total emplacement time of the body. The transition from a mafic crystal-poor magma to a partially molten rock that retains a highly differentiated melt is fast, whereas the resulting evolved residual melt can reside in the crust for protracted periods. As long as temperatures in the system are relatively low, highly differentiated melts are generated, which may explain the bi-modal character and the absence of intermediate compositions in some magmatic provinces. The level of emplacement of successive magma pulses controls the shape of the thermal anomaly associated with the magma body growth. Metamorphism, partial melting and assimilation of the country rock are favoured if successive magma sheets are emplaced at or close to the country rock-magma body boundary. If the magma emplacement rate is low, the size of the thermal aureole is controlled by the size of one pulse and not by the size of the entire igneous body. Understanding emplacement of magma bodies is fundamental for our understanding of the plutonism-volcanism relationship. Magma emplacement rates of several centimetres per year are needed for a magma body to evolve into a large magma chamber able to feed large silicic explosive eruptions. The time-averaged emplacement rates of plutons are lower than this critical emplacement rate. Eruptions of 100s to 1000s cubic kilometres of silicic products show that such high volumes of magmas can accumulate in the upper crust. This suggests that the emplacement of magma bodies is a multi-timescale process with the development of large magma chambers corresponding to the highest magma fluxes. Because they control magmatic processes and the impact of magma intrusion on the country rock, future studies should focus on magma emplacement rates and on magma emplacement geometries. These studies should integrate field observation on plutons and geophysical data on active magmatic systems, coupled with laboratory experiments and numerical simulations. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

Crustal temperatures and surface heat fluxes are then calculated from the upper mantle temperature assuming steady state thermal conduction. The temperature at the top of the asthenosphere beneath the oceanic region and West Antarctica is higher than the dry mantle solidus, indicating the presence of melt. From the temperature values, we generate depth maps of the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary and the Curie temperature isotherm. The maps show that East Antarctica has a thick lithosphere similar to that of other stable cratons, with the thickest lithosphere ({$\sim$}250 km) between Domes A and C. The thin crust and lithosphere beneathWest Antarctica are similar to those of modern subduction-related rift systems in East Asia. A cold region beneath the Antarctic Peninsula is similar in spatial extent to that of a flat-subducted slab beneath the southern Andes, indicating a possible remnant of the Phoenix Plate, which was subducted prior to 10Ma. The oceanic lithosphere generally thickens with increasing age, and the age-thickness correlation depends on the spreading rate of the ridge that formed the lithosphere. Significant flattening of the age-thickness curves is not observed for the mature oceanic lithosphere of the Antarctic Plate. 1.},

To test the reliability of the spectral content of this model, for a small region, we compare he CPD derived from the EMM2010 against the one from aeromagnetic data. We also compile heat flow data from previous studies to correlate them with the CPD lateral variations. The estimations show that the CPD in Venezuela and the Eastern Caribbean ranges between 54 and 17km. The mean depth value within the continental crust is around 38km. On the Guayana Shield, it has a mean value of 42km and reaches a maximum of 54km. As the Moho depth is at most 50km, the upper mantle beneath the craton is magnetized. Continental lateral variations appear to be linked to the isostatic state and age of the different provinces, and mark the limit between the Precambrian and the Paleozoic provinces. The Maracaibo Basin is revealed as a thermally stable one with a constant CPD, while the Eastern Venezuela Basin is thermally affected. Most of the Eastern Caribbean seems stable, with a large non-perturbed area with a mean CPD value of 23km. As the crustal thickness is at most 20km, the isotherm is located within the upper mantle. A CPD minimum located on the Lesser Antilles arc is concentrated in its northern part, and can be related to the subduction zone that is most active. Finally, a shallow area within the Eastern Caribbean corresponds to the thin crust region in the Venezuela Basin, although it might be linked to mantle dynamics.},

This suggests that an arm of plume material has extended, or is extending, from Iceland, in a direction perpendicular to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Here we present the results of a detailed teleseismic traveltime study that reveals the high-resolution morphology of this low-velocity anomaly beneath the British Isles. Our images provide insights into the nature of plume-lithosphere interactions. The low-velocity anomaly imaged in this study correlates geographically with a region of high gravity anomalies and high topography that was associated with Paleogene magmatism and phases of epeirogenic uplift during the Cenozoic Era. There is evidence that the distribution of British earthquakes is also related to the low-velocity anomaly. The low-velocity anomaly is interpreted to represent hot material from the original Iceland plume head that became trapped beneath thinned regions of lithosphere ca. 60 Ma.},

Journal of Geophysical Research 106, 16387-16414.] show strong correlation with tectono-thermal ages and with regional variations in lithospheric thickness constrained by surface heat flow data and seismic velocities. In agreement with xenolith data, strong positive velocity anomalies of non-thermal origin (attributed to mantle depletion) are clearly seen for all of the cratons; their amplitude, however, varies laterally and decreases with depth, reflecting either a peripheral growth of the cratons in Proterozoic or their peripheral reworking. These cratonic regions where kimberlite magmas erupted show only weakly positive compositional velocity anomalies, atypical for the "intact" cratonic mantle. A reduction in the amplitude of compositional velocity anomalies in kimberlite provinces is interpreted to result from metasomatic enrichment (prior or during kimberlite emplacement) of the cratonic mantle, implying that xenolith data maybe non-representative of the "intact" cratonic mantle.},

  abstract = {Most of the East European Craton lacks surface relief; however, the amplitude of topography at the top of the basement exceeds 20 km, the amplitude of topography undulations at the crustal base reaches almost 30 km with an amazing amplitude of ca. 50 km in variation in the thickness of the crystalline crust, and the amplitude of topography variations at the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary exceeds 200 km. This paper examines the relative contributions of the crust, the subcrustal lithosphere, and the dynamic support of the sublithospheric mantle to maintain surface topography, using regional seismic data on the structure of the crystalline crust and the sedimentary cover, and thermal and large-scale P- and S-wave seismic tomography data on the structure of the lithospheric mantle. For the Precambrian lithosphere, an analysis of Vp/Vs ratio at 100, 150, 200, and 250 km depths does not show any age-dependence, suggesting that while Vp/Vs ratio can be effectively used to outline the cratonic margins, it is not sensitive to compositional variations within the cratonic lithosphere. Statistical analysis of age-dependence of velocity, density, and thermal structure of the continental crust and subcrustal lithosphere in the study area (0-62E, 45-72N) allows to link lithospheric structure with the tectonic evolution of the region since the Archean. Crustal thickness decreases systematically with age from 42-44 km in regions older than 1.6 Ga to 37-40 km in the Paleozoic-Mesoproterozoic structures, and to ca. 31 km in the Meso-Cenozoic regions. However, the isostatic contribution of the crust to the surface topography of the East European Craton is almost independent of age (ca. 4.5 km) due to an interplay of age-dependent crustal and sedimentary thicknesses and lithospheric temperatures. On the contrary, the contribution of the subcrustal lithosphere to the surface topography strongly depends on the age, being slightly positive (+0.3+0.7 km) for the regions older than 1.6 Ga and negative (-0.5-1 km) for younger structures. This leads to age-dependent variations in the residual topography, i.e. the topography which cannot be explained by the assumed thermal and density structure of the lithosphere, and which can (at least partly) originate from the dynamic component caused by the mantle flow. Positive dynamic topography at the cratonic margins, which exceeds 2 km in the Norwegian Caledonides and in the Urals, clearly links their on-going uplift with deep mantle processes. Negative residual topography beneath the Archean-Paleoproterozoic cratons (-1-2 km) indicates either a smaller density deficit (ca. 0.9\%) in their subcrustal lithosphere than predicted by global petrologic data on mantle-derived xenoliths or the presence of a strong convective downwelling in the mantle. Such mantle downflows can effectively divert heat from the lithospheric base, leading to a long-term survival of the Archean-Paleoproterozoic lithosphere.},

  abstract = {An overview of seismic, thermal, and petrological evidence on the structure of Precambrian lithosphere suggests that its local maximum thickness is highly variable (140-350 km), with a bimodal distribution for Archean cratons (200-220 km and 300-350 km). We discuss the origin of such large differences in lithospheric thickness, and propose that the lithospheric base can have large depth variations over short distances. The topography of Bryce Canyon (western USA) is proposed as an inverted analog of the base of the lithosphere. The horizontal and vertical dimensions of Archean cratons are strongly correlated: larger cratons have thicker lithosphere. Analysis of the bimodal distribution of lithospheric thickness in Archean cratons shows that the "critical" surface area for cratons to have thick ({\textbackslash}textgreater300 km) keels is {\textbackslash}textgreater6-8X10 (super 6) km (super 2) . Extrapolation of the linear trend between Archean lithospheric thickness and cratonic area to zero area yields a thickness of 180 km. This implies that the reworking of Archean crust should be accompanied by thinning and reworking of the entire lithospheric column to a thickness of 180 km in accord with thickness estimates for Proterozoic lithosphere. Likewise, extrapolation of the same trend to the size equal to the total area of all Archean cratons implies that the lithospheric thickness of a hypothesized early Archean supercontinent could have been 350-450 km decreasing to 280-400 km for Gondwanaland. We evaluate the basal drag model as a possible mechanism that may thin the cratonic lithosphere. Inverse correlations are found between lithospheric thickness and (a) fractional subduction length and (b) the effective ridge length. In agreement with theoretical predictions, lithospheric thickness of Archean keels is proportional to the square root of the ratio of the craton length (along the direction of plate motion) to the plate velocity. Large cratons with thick keels and low plate velocities are less eroded by basal drag than small fast-moving cratons. Basal drag may have varied in magnitude over the past 4 Ga. Higher mantle temperatures in the Archean would have resulted in lower mantle viscosity. This in turn would have reduced basal drag and basal erosion, and promoted the preservation of thick ({\textbackslash}textgreater300 km) Archean keels, even if plate velocities were high during the Archean.},

In order to\${\textbackslash}backslash\$nevaluate the relative contributions of thermal and nonthermal effects\${\textbackslash}backslash\$non anomalies of attenuation of seismic shear waves, Qs-1,\${\textbackslash}backslash\$nand seismic velocity, Vs, we compare global maps of the\${\textbackslash}backslash\$nthermal structure of the continental upper mantle with global Qs-1\${\textbackslash}backslash\$nand Vs maps as determined from Rayleigh waves at periods\${\textbackslash}backslash\$nbetween 40 and 150 s. We limit the comparison to three continental\${\textbackslash}backslash\$nmantle depths (50, 100 and 150 km), where model resolution is relatively\${\textbackslash}backslash\$nhigh. The available data set does not indicate that, at a global\${\textbackslash}backslash\$nscale, seismic anomalies in the upper mantle are controlled solely\${\textbackslash}backslash\$nby temperature variations. Continental maps have correlation coefficients\${\textbackslash}backslash\$nof {\textbackslash}textless0.56 between Vs and T and of {\textbackslash}textless0.47 between Qs\${\textbackslash}backslash\$nand T at any depth. Such low correlation coefficients can partially\${\textbackslash}backslash\$nbe attributed to modelling artefacts; however, they also suggest\${\textbackslash}backslash\$nthat not all of the Vs and Qs anomalies in\${\textbackslash}backslash\$nthe continental upper mantle can be explained by T variations. Global\${\textbackslash}backslash\$nmaps show that, by the sign of the anomaly, Vs and Qs\${\textbackslash}backslash\$nusually inversely correlate with lithospheric temperatures: most\${\textbackslash}backslash\$ncratonic regions show high Vs and Qs and low\${\textbackslash}backslash\$nT, while most active regions have seismic and thermal anomalies of\${\textbackslash}backslash\$nthe opposite sign. The strongest inverse correlation is found at\${\textbackslash}backslash\$na depth of 100 km, where the attenuation model is best resolved.\${\textbackslash}backslash\$nSignificantly, at this depth, the contours of near-zero Qs\${\textbackslash}backslash\$nanomalies approximately correspond to the 1000{$^\circ$}C isotherm, in\${\textbackslash}backslash\$nagreement with laboratory measurements that show a pronounced increase\${\textbackslash}backslash\$nin seismic attenuation in upper mantle rocks at 1000-1100{$^\circ$}C.\${\textbackslash}backslash\$nEast-west profiles of Vs, Qs and T where continental\${\textbackslash}backslash\$ndata coverage is best (50{$^\circ$}N latitude for North America and 60{$^\circ$}N\${\textbackslash}backslash\$nlatitude for Eurasia) further demonstrate that temperature plays\${\textbackslash}backslash\$na dominant, but nonunique, role in determining the value of lithospheric\${\textbackslash}backslash\$nVs and Qs. At 100 km depth, where the resolution\${\textbackslash}backslash\$nof seismic models is the highest, we compare observed seismic Vs\${\textbackslash}backslash\$nand Qs with theoretical VsT, QsT\${\textbackslash}backslash\$nvalues, respectively, that are calculated solely from temperature\${\textbackslash}backslash\$nanomalies and constrained by experimental data on temperature dependencies\${\textbackslash}backslash\$nof velocity and attenuation. This comparison shows that temperature\${\textbackslash}backslash\$nvariations alone are sufficient to explain seismic Vs\${\textbackslash}backslash\$nand Qs in ca 50 per cent of continental regions.

Previous studies of Moho geometry in the northern Canadian Cordillera (NCC) using very sparse seismic data have indicated a flat and shallow ({$\sim$}30--35\,\,km) Moho, despite an average elevation of \&gt;1000\,\,m above sea level attributable to increased thermal buoyancy and lower crustal flow due to elevated temperatures. We estimate Moho depth using receiver functions from an expanded dataset incorporating 173 past and recently deployed broadband seismic stations, including the EarthScope Transportable Array, Mackenzie Mountains transect, and other recent deployments. We determine Moho depths in the range 27--43~km, with mean and standard deviations of 33.0 and 3.0~km, respectively, and note thickened crust beneath high-elevation seismogenic regions. In the Mackenzie Mountains, thicker crust is interpreted as due to crustal stacking from thrust sheet emplacement. The edge of this region of thickened crust is interpreted to delineate the extent of the former Laurentian margin beneath the NCC and is associated with a transition from thrust to strike-slip faulting observed in regional seismicity. More geographically extensive seismograph deployments at EarthScope Transportable Array density and scale will be required to further extend crustal-scale and lithosphere-scale imaging in western Canada.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY             It is generally agreed that the Last Interglacial (LIG; {$\sim$}130--115~ka) was a time when global average temperatures and global mean sea level were higher than they are today. However, the exact timing, magnitude and spatial pattern of ice melt is much debated. One difficulty in extracting past global mean sea level from local observations is that their elevations need to be corrected for glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA), which requires knowledge of Earth's internal viscoelastic structure. While this structure is generally assumed to be radially symmetric, evidence from seismology, geodynamics and mineral physics indicates that large lateral variations in viscosity exist within the mantle. In this study, we construct a new model of Earth's internal structure by converting shear wave speed into viscosity using parametrizations from mineral physics experiments and geodynamic constraints on Earth's thermal structure. We use this 3-D Earth structure, which includes both variations in lithospheric thickness and lateral variations in viscosity, to calculate the first 3-D GIA prediction for LIG sea level. We find that the difference between predictions with and without lateral Earth structure can be metres to 10s of metres in the near field of former ice sheets, and up to a few metres in their far field. We demonstrate how forebulge dynamics and continental levering are affected by laterally varying Earth structure, with a particular focus on those sites with prominent LIG sea level records. Results from four 3-D GIA calculations show that accounting for lateral structure can act to increase local sea level by up to {$\sim$}1.5~m at the Seychelles and minimally decrease it in Western Australia. We acknowledge that this result is only based on a few simulations, but if robust, this shift brings estimates of global mean sea level from these two sites into closer agreement with each other. We further demonstrate that simulations with a suitable radial viscosity profile can be used to locally approximate the 3-D GIA result, but that these radial profiles cannot be found by simply averaging viscosity below the sea level indicator site.},

We test the hypothesis that this change in plate motion was initiated by cessation of subduction along the northern Melanesian arc due to the collision between the arc and the Ontong Java plateau. This hypothesis has long been formulated but never tested quantitatively. We use a geomechanical model of the lithosphere to determine the changes in plate boundary forces that are necessary to obtain the observed change in the Pacific plate motion. Our model results show that the change in motion can be explained by a clockwise rotation of the slab-related (basal-strength) component of plate driving force. The change of slab-related force from a post-6Ma to a pre-6Ma setting is perpendicular to the arc and points towards the Australian plate. The force per unit length is in the range of currently accepted values for subduction zones. Since there have been no other relevant changes at subduction zones along the Pacific plate boundary during the latest Miocene, we relate this change in slab-related force to the former southward-dipping Pacific plate slab along the northern Melanesian arc system which is now detached. Our model results suggest that rapid changes in plate motion can be triggered by slab detachment, with consequences for plate boundary processes even at great distances from the event.}

We suggest that grain-size evolution during deformation is determined by the rate of mechanical work. Provided that other elements of microstructure have achieved steady state and that the dissipation rate is roughly constant, then changes in internal energy will be proportional to changes in grain-boundary area. If normal grain-growth and dynamic grain-size reduction occur simultaneously, then the steady-state grain size is determined by the balance of those rates. A scaling model using these assumptions and published grain-growth and mechanical relations matches stress--grain-size relations for quartz and olivine rocks with no fitting. For marbles, the model also explains scatter not rationalized by assuming that recrystallized grain size is a function of stress alone. When extrapolated to conditions typical for natural mylonites, the model is consistent with field constraints on stresses and strain rates.},

In this study, a different algorithm was introduced to estimate the magnetic basement depth from map data. The algorithm is based on the analytical solution of exponential equations obtained from Fourier transformation of magnetic data. This algorithm has been tested on synthetic magnetic anomalies originated from multi-prisms. Following encouraging test results, the proposed algorithm was also tested on field data. The depths obtained from the proposed approach were satisfactory in comparison with the depths obtained from seismic survey cross-sections and boreholes.

We construct 18 3D Earth structures that are derived from seismic tomography models and are geodynamically constrained. We consider uncertainties in 3D viscosity structures that arise from variations in the conversion from seismic velocity to temperature variations (factor r) and radial viscosity profiles (RVP). We apply these Earth models to a 3D GIA model, VILMA, to investigate the influence of such structure on RSL predictions. The variabilities in 3D Earth structures and RSL predictions are investigated for globally distributed sites and applied for comparisons with regional 1D models for ice center (North America, Antarctica) and peripheral regions (Central Oregon Coast, San Jorge Gulf).},

Here we reconstruct landscape history since the late Eocene by investigating the interplay between mantle convection, lithosphere dynamics, climate, and surface processes using fully coupled four-dimensional numerical models. Our quantified depth-dependent strain rate and stress history within the lithosphere, under the influence of gravitational collapse and sub-lithospheric mantle flow, show that high gravitational potential energy of a mountain chain relative to a lower Colorado Plateau can explain extension directions and stress magnitudes in the belt of metamorphic core complexes during topographic collapse. Profound lithospheric weakening through heating and partial melting, following slab rollback, promoted this extensional collapse. Landscape evolution guided northeast drainage onto the Colorado Plateau during the late Eocene-late Oligocene, south-southwest drainage reversal during the late Oligocene-middle Miocene, and southwest drainage following the late Miocene.},

  abstract = {Active Heating-Distributed Temperature Sensing (AH-DTS) has the potential to allow for the measurement of groundwater flow velocities in situ. We placed DTS fiber-optic cables combined with a heating wire in direct contact with aquifer sediments in a laboratory scale groundwater flow simulator. Using this setup, we empirically determined the relationship between {$\Delta$}T, the temperature difference by constant and uniform heating of the DTS cable and the background temperature of the groundwater system, and horizontal groundwater flow velocity. Second, we simulated the observed temperature response of the system using a plan-view heat transfer flow model to calibrate for the thermal properties of the sediment and to optimize cable setup for sensitivity to variation in groundwater flow velocities. Additionally, we derived an analytical solution based on the heat flow equation that can be used to explicitly calculate flow velocity from measured {$\Delta$}T for this specific AH-DTS cable setup. We expect that this equation, after calibration for cable constitution, is valid for estimating groundwater flow velocity based on absolute temperature differences measured in field applications using this cable setup.},

  abstract = {The identification of vadose zone hydrological pathways that most accurately transmit climate signals through karst aquifers to stalagmites is critical for accurately interpreting climate proxies contained within individual stalagmites. A three-year cave drip hydrochemical study across a spectrum of drip types in Crag Cave, SW Ireland, reveals substantial variability in drip hydrochemical behaviour. Stalagmites fed by very slow drips ({\textbackslash}textless 0.1??ml/min) may best retain information regarding decadal- through millennial-scale climate because the drip sites' diffuse recharge minimizes interferences to the long-term pattern produced by isolated meteorological events. Additionally, hydrological routing shifts did not influence these very slow drips. Intermediate flow regimes (0.1-2??ml/min) are apparently most sensitive to water excess, and may best preserve a paleoseasonality signal because of a combination of rapid stalagmite growth, seasonally responsive drip rates, and minimal interferences from stochastic processes within the aquifer. Stochastic drip-rate variability existed at several high-discharge ({\textbackslash}textgreater 2??ml/min) sites, apparently unconnected with local meteorological events. Water from these drips was typically undersaturated with respect to calcite, and thus did not result in calcite deposition. Data presented here suggest that drips in this flow regime also experience flow re-routing and blocking, and that any stalagmites developed under such drips are unsuitable as mid- to high-resolution paleoclimate proxies. Most drip sites demonstrated seasonal [Ca2+] and [Mg2+] variability that was probably linked to water excess. Prior calcite precipitation along the flowpath affected the chemistry of slowly dripping sites, while dilution predominantly controlled the water chemistry of the more rapidly dripping sites. This research underscores the importance of understanding drip hydrology prior to selecting stalagmites for paleoclimate analysis and before interpreting any subsequent proxy data. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Cave air PCO2 at two Irish sites varied dramatically on daily to seasonal timescales, potentially affecting the timing of calcite deposition and consequently climate proxy records derived from stalagmites collected at the same sites. Temperature-dependent biochemical processes in the soil control CO2 production, resulting in high summer PCO2 values and low winter values at both sites. Large Large-amplitude, high-frequency variations superimposed on this seasonal cycle reflect cave air circulation. Here we model stalagmite growth rates, which are controlled partly by CO2 degassing rates from drip water, by considering both the seasonal and high-frequency cave air PCO2 variations. Modeled hourly growth rates for stalagmite CC-Bil from Crag Cave in SW Ireland reach maxima in late December (0.063????m h- 1) and minima in late June/early July (0.033????m h- 1). For well-mixed 'diffuse flow' cave drips such as those that feed CC-Bil, high summer cave air PCO2 depresses summer calcite deposition, while low winter PCO2 promotes degassing and enhances deposition rates. In stalagmites fed by well-mixed drips lacking seasonal variations in ??18O, integrated annual stalagmite calcite ??18O is unaffected; however, seasonality in cave air PCO2 may influence non-conservative geochemical climate proxies (e.g., ??13C, Sr/Ca). Stalagmites fed by 'seasonal' drips whose hydrochemical properties vary in response to seasonality may have higher growth rates in summer because soil air PCO2 may increase relative to cave air PCO2 due to higher soil temperatures. This in turn may bias stalagmite calcite ??18O records towards isotopically heavier summer drip water ??18O values, resulting in elevated calcite ??18O values compared to the 'equilibrium' values predicted by calcite-water isotope fractionation equations. Interpretations of stalagmite-based paleoclimate proxies should therefore consider the consequences of cave air PCO2 variability and the resulting intra-annual variability in calcite deposition rates.

Cosmochemical arguments indicate that lower-mantle rocks may be enriched in Si relative to upper-mantle pyrolite, whereas seismic tomography images suggest whole-mantle convection and hence appear to imply efficient mantle mixing. This study reconciles cosmochemical and geophysical constraints using the stagnation of some slab segments at {$\sim$}1000-km depth as the key observation. Through numerical modeling of subduction, we show that lower-mantle enrichment in intrinsically dense basaltic lithologies can render slabs neutrally buoyant in the uppermost lower mantle. Slab stagnation (at depths of {$\sim$}660 and {$\sim$}1000 km) and unimpeded slab sinking to great depths can coexist if the basalt fraction is {$\sim$}8\% higher in the lower mantle than in the upper mantle, equivalent to a lower-mantle Mg/Si of {$\sim$}1.18. Global-scale geodynamic models demonstrate that such a moderate compositional gradient across the mantle can persist can in the presence of whole-mantle convection.},

Smaller DBMS were estimated for the Moldanubian region in southern Germany and the northern part of the North German basin. A comparison of DBMS with heat-flow data, crustal temperatures at 3-km depths, and Moho depth indicates that DBMS is controlled by the geothermal condition of the earth's crust in Germany and lithologic changes. Although the Upper Rhine graben and the Moldanubian region are characterized by small DBMS, a change in DBMS values in northern Germany seems to be related to the Elbe lineament.},

The upper medium is discretized into rectangular, juxtaposed prisms whose thicknesses represent the depths to the interface and are the parameters to be estimated from the gravity anomaly. To stabilize the inversion, we introduce two kinds of constraints on the depths. The first one requires proximity between the observed and computed depths at isolated points such as those obtained from boreholes (absolute equality constraint). The second one requires that groups of depths approximately follow an established linear relationship among them (relative equality constraint). Both kinds of constraints are imposed in the least-squares sense. This stabilization procedure does not bias the solution either toward an initial approximation, or toward the null solution. The method is applied to synthetic data, producing a good reconstruction of a complex basement consisting of several structural high and lows. It is also applied to real data of Reconcavo Basin, Brazil, leading to a sharper definition of the basement structures as compared with previous gravity interpretations of the area.}

  abstract = {SUMMARY             The Eastern Mediterranean is the most seismically active region in Europe due to the complex interactions of the Arabian, African, and Eurasian tectonic plates. Deformation is achieved by faulting in the brittle crust, distributed flow in the viscoelastic lower-crust and mantle, and Hellenic subduction, but the long-term partitioning of these mechanisms is still unknown. We exploit an extensive suite of geodetic observations to build a kinematic model connecting strike-slip deformation, extension, subduction, and shear localization across Anatolia and the Aegean Sea by mapping the distribution of slip and strain accumulation on major active geological structures. We find that tectonic escape is facilitated by a plate-boundary-like, trans-lithospheric shear zone extending from the Gulf of Evia to the Turkish-Iranian Plateau that underlies the surface trace of the North Anatolian Fault. Additional deformation in Anatolia is taken up by a series of smaller-scale conjugate shear zones that reach the upper mantle, the largest of which is located beneath the East Anatolian Fault. Rapid north--south extension in the western part of the system, driven primarily by Hellenic Trench retreat, is accommodated by rotation and broadening of the North Anatolian mantle shear zone from the Sea of Marmara across the north Aegean Sea, and by a system of distributed transform faults and rifts including the rapidly extending Gulf of Corinth in central Greece and the active grabens of western Turkey. Africa--Eurasia convergence along the Hellenic Arc occurs at a median rate of 49.8\,mm\,yr--1 in a largely trench-normal direction except near eastern Crete where variably oriented slip on the megathrust coincides with mixed-mode and strike-slip deformation in the overlying accretionary wedge near the Ptolemy--Pliny--Strabo trenches. Our kinematic model illustrates the competing roles the North Anatolian mantle shear zone, Hellenic Trench, overlying mantle wedge, and active crustal faults play in accommodating tectonic indentation, slab rollback and associated Aegean extension. Viscoelastic flow in the lower crust and upper mantle dominate the surface velocity field across much of Anatolia and a clear transition to megathrust-related slab pull occurs in western Turkey, the Aegean Sea and Greece. Crustal scale faults and the Hellenic wedge contribute only a minor amount to the large-scale, regional pattern of Eastern Mediterranean interseismic surface deformation.},

The generalization permits identification with aspects of other point or node based discrete solution techniques which do not use a body--fixed grid, i.e. the ``meshless methods''. Similarities are noted and some practical advantages relative to some of these methods are identified. Examples are used to demonstrate and explain numerical artifact noise which can be expected in MPM calculations. This noise results in nonphysical local variations at the material points, where constitutive response is evaluated. It is shown to destroy the explicit solution in one case, and seriously degrade it in another. History dependent, inelastic constitutive laws can be expected to evolve erroneously and report inaccurate stress states because of noisy input. The noise is due to the lack of smoothness of the interpolation functions, and occurs due to material points crossing computational grid boundaries. The next degree of smoothness available in the GIMP methods is shown to be capable of eliminating cell crossing noise.},

  abstract = {Depressions (or pits) are areas within a digital elevation model that are surrounded by higher terrain, with no outlet to lower areas. Filling them so they are level, as fluid would fill them if the terrain was impermeable, is often necessary in preprocessing DEMs. The depression-filling algorithm presented here - called Priority-Flood - unifies and improves the work of a number of previous authors who have published similar algorithms. The algorithm operates by flooding DEMs inwards from their edges using a priority queue to determine the next cell to be flooded. The resultant DEM has no depressions or digital dams: every cell is guaranteed to drain. The algorithm is optimal for both integer and floating-point data, working in O(n) and O(n log2 n) time, respectively. It is shown that by using a plain queue to fill depressions once they have been found, an O(m log2 m) time-complexity can be achieved, where m does not exceed the number of cells n. This is the lowest time complexity of any known floating-point depression-filling algorithm. In testing, this improved variation of the algorithm performed up to 37\% faster than the original. Additionally, a parallel version of an older, but widely used, depression-filling algorithm required six parallel processors to achieve a run-time on par with what the newer algorithm's improved variation took on a single processor. The Priority-Flood Algorithm is simple to understand and implement: the included pseudocode is only 20 lines and the included C++ reference implementation is under a hundred lines. The algorithm can work on irregular meshes as well as 4-, 6-, 8-, and n-connected grids. It can also be adapted to label watersheds and determine flow directions through either incremental elevation changes or depression carving. In the case of incremental elevation changes, the algorithm includes safety checks not present in prior works. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Late Pleistocene glaciation of Australia was restricted to the Snowy Mountains and the Tasmanian highlands. Glaciers were most extensive in Tasmania where ice caps formed on the Central Plateau and West Coast Ranges, and systems of valley and cirque glaciers formed on surrounding mountains. To investigate the timing of maximum glacier advance during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), we dated boulders on 18 moraines in 8 glaciated areas using cosmogenic 36Cl and 10Be. We sampled moraines deposited by cirque and valley glaciers, in a range of climate types and lithologies over a 7{$^\circ$} latitudinal and a 1430m altitudinal transect. Exposure ages for LGM moraine boulders group tightly in the range 17-20 ka. Boulders from the Hamilton moraine, often treated as the LGM type moraine, range in age from {$\sim$}190-350 ka, indicating that it was deposited well before the last glaciation. Collectively, the exposure ages show that southeastern Australia was glaciated briefly during and after the LGM, and deglaciated well before the Holocene. Ice retreated from the terminal moraines after the period of coldest sea-surface temperatures in the southwest Pacific Ocean. No evidence was found for readvance of glaciers during the Antarctic Cold Reversal or the Younger Dryas period. {\copyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The Lithosphere Seismic Profile in Britain (LISPB), shot in 1974, included a 700 km long north-south profile of the crust and upper mantle of northern Britain. The wide-angle seismic data from LISPB was of exceptional quality and coverage making a reinterpretation using current modelling programs worthwhile. This reinterpreta-tion shows that the original crustal model published by Bamford et al. (1978) satisfies the observed first arrival traveltimes, but that further detail of crustal velocity structure may be obtained by modelling first and later arrivals using synthetic seismograms. The new model shows strong variations in crustal velocity structure that appear to be correlated with geological and tectonic structures mapped at the surface. The new lithospheric model is compatible with the observed gravity field when converted to appropriate densities, and the variations in loading along the base of the density model show that the lithosphere is close to local isostatic equilibrium. Profiles of the variation of velocity and density with depth from the new model are compared with measurements of Lewisian rocks made at confining pressures up to 8 kbar, allowing the seismic model to be interpreted geologically. A synthetic normal incidence profile of the new model is superimposed on the nearby NEC deep seismic reflection profile, and the features imaged by the two techniques are compared.},

  abstract = {Combined analysis of seismic P and S velocity information provides a reasonable and efficient basis for the petrologic interpretation of seismic cross sections. In this paper, a methodology is presented which allows extraction of prominent features related to well-defined P velocities and Poisson's ratios from a tomographic velocity model using a classification approach. We used first-arrival travel time data from a near-vertical seismic experiment and independently determined P and S velocities by forward and inverse modeling. Resolution and uncertainties were estimated from inverting synthetic data. The classification procedure was carried out in two subsequent steps. First, prominent classes were identified in the parameter space spanned by Poisson's ratios and P wave velocities. For this purpose, a probability density function was calculated from the tomograms. A function measuring the topography of the probability density was then determined, and a histogram analysis was carried out to detect significant classes. In the second step, the results from principal component analysis for the identified classes were used to map their distribution along the seismic profile. We applied the method to the Messum intrusive complex of Namibia and identified three prominent classes. On the basis of the integration of petrophysical data and comparison with surface geology, we conclude that quartz-syenite composition dominates the upper 800 m of the crust under the complex. Outside of the intrusion the upper crust has properties corresponding to felsic metasediments and granites which are abundant in the local basement. This material shows strong depth-dependent changes of seismic properties which are ascribed to decreasing porosity and fluid saturation with depth.},

  abstract = {Abstract. During the Geophysical Measurements Across the Continental Margin of Namibia (MAMBA) experiments, offshore and onshore refraction and reflection seismic as well as magnetic data were collected. Together with the existing free-air gravity data, these were used to derive two crustal sections across the ocean- continent transition. The results show that the Early Cretaceous continental breakup and the separation of South Africa and South America were accompanied by excessive igneous activity offshore. Off Namibia we found a 150-200 km wide zone of igneous crust up to 25 km thick. The upper part of this zone consists of an extrusive section comprising three units of basaltic composition: two distinct wedges of seaward dipping reflectors (SDRs) separated by flat-lying volcanic flows. The inner wedge of SDRs can be modeled as the source of a long-wavelength magnetic anomaly that borders long parts of both South Atlantic margins (anomaly G). The crust underneath these extrusives is characterized by high-velocity and high-density material (average values 7 km s -1, 3 x 103 kg m-3). Free-air gravity anomalies along both sides of the high-density crust are interpreted as edge effects resulting from juxtaposition with normal oceanic and continental crust on either side. We define the abrupt landward termination of this zone as the continent-ocean boundary, and consequently, the crust seaward is interpreted as exclusively igneous material and not intruded continental crust. Extrapolation of the interpreted geophysical features along the southwest African margin suggests a fast prograding narrow rift zone and sharp lithospheric rupture leading to the formation of a margin-parallel magmatic belt south of the Walvis Ridge. The influence of the Tristan da Cunha mantle plume may explain the widening of this thick igneous crust near the Walvis Ridge.},

  abstract = {Joint interpretation of models from seismic tomography and inversion of magnetotelluric (MT) data is an efficient approach to determine the lithology of the subsurface. Statistical methods are well established but were developed for only two types of models so far (seismic P velocity and electrical resistivity). We apply self-organizing maps (SOMs), which have no limitations in the number of parameters considered in the joint interpretation. Our SOM method includes (1) generation of data vectors from the seismic and MT images, (2) unsupervised learning, (3) definition of classes by algorithmic segmentation of the SOM using image processing techniques and (4) application of learned knowledge to classify all data vectors and assign a lithological interpretation for each data vector. We apply the workflow to collocated P velocity, vertical P-velocity gradient and resistivity models derived along a 40 km profile around the geothermal site Groc Schonebeck in the Northeast German Basin. The resulting lithological model consists of eight classes covering Cenozoic, Mesozoic and Palaeozoic sediments down to 5 km depth. There is a remarkable agreement between the litho-type distribution from the SOM analysis and regional marker horizons interpolated from sparse 2-D industrial reflection seismic data. The most interesting features include (1) characteristic properties of the Jurassic (low P-velocity gradients, low resistivity values) interpreted as the signature of shales, and (2) a pattern within the Upper Permian Zechstein layer with low resistivity and increased P-velocity values within the salt depressions and increased resistivity and decreased P velocities in the salt pillows. The latter is explained in our interpretation by flow of less dense salt matrix components to form the pillows while denser and more brittle evaporites such as anhydrite remain in place during the salt mobilization. 2012 The Authors Geophysical Journal International 2012 RAS.},

We broaden the numerical model investigation to explore three flow modes: homogeneous channel flow (involving laterally homogeneous crust); heterogeneous channel flow (involving laterally heterogeneous lower crust that is expelled and incorporated into the mid-crustal channel flow); and the hot fold nappes style of flow (in which mid-/lower crust is forcibly expelled outward over a lower crustal indentor to create fold nappes that are inserted into the mid-crust). The three flow modes are members of a continuum in which the homogeneous mode is driven by gravitational forces but requires very weak channel material. The hot fold nappe mode is driven tectonically by, for example, collision with a strong crustal indentor and can occur in crust that is subcritical for homogeneous flows. The heterogeneous mode combines tectonic and gravitationally driven flows. Preliminary results also demonstrate the existence and behaviour of mid-crustal channels during advancing and retreating dynamical mantle lithosphere subduction. An orogen temperature-magnitude (T-M) diagram is proposed and the positions of orogens in T-M space that may exhibit the flow modes are described, together with the characteristic positions of a range of other orogen types.}

The nine networks contain a total of 362 Global Positioning System (GPS) stations that have been observed at least twice and at least a year apart between 1991 and 1998. The model velocity field is expanded as bicubic spline interpolation functions defined within a curvilinear grid that covers the country and extends into the assumed rigid Australian and Pacific plates to west and east. The inversion jointly minimizes the magnitudes of fitted strain rates and the misfit to the observed velocity data. The spline technique allows high spatial resolution of strain rate variations, especially in regions with spatially dense GPS data. Expansion of the model velocity field on the surface of a sphere allows arbitrarily large areas to be studied. Previously known aspects of New Zealand plate boundary deformation are highlighted with improved resolution, including back-arc extension in the Taupo Volcanic Zone, rotation of the Hikurangi forearc away from this zone in the North Island, and a band of high shear strain rate under the Southern Alps to the southeast of the Alpine fault. Our results reveal several new features, including a region of enhanced shear straining apparently associated with strike-slip faults in the southern North Island and a band of contractional straining subparallel and well east of the Alpine fault that is similar to features found in numerical and sandbox models of continental collision.},

However, important activities such as the Wisconsin glacial cycle must have been accompanied by temperature changes of global extent. Therefore, even those continental areas that were not subject to glaciation may have suffered important mean surface temperature changes, thus leading to the need to correct heat-flow measurements made in such areas. Furthermore, there have been significant widespread changes in climate during the Holocene, leading to a need to correct for short-term temperature changes as well. Applying corrections to existing data for a surface thermal history of the Holocene and Pleistocene, it is found that correlation between heat-flow values and borehole depths are significantly reduced, that both positive and negative correlations of heat flow with conductivity may be due to neglect of climatic corrections, and that many heat-flow values, particularly from shallow holes (less than 400 meters deep), may need corrections of several tenths of a heat-flow unit (several mW m-2). It is concluded that mean heat-flow values for heat-flow provinces, and continents as a whole, may be too low by as much as 20 or 30\% and that the mean oceanic and continental heat-flow values may not be equal.}

After a spherical harmonic expansion, we find the spectral power and radial correlation of each tomographic model as a function of depth and harmonic degree. We then calculate the correlation, at the same depths and degrees, between all possible pairs of models, to identify stable and model-dependent features ( the former being usually of longer spatial wavelength than the latter). We can therefore evaluate the degree of robust structure that seismologists have mapped so far and proceed to calculate ad hoc mean reference models. Tomographic models are furthermore compared with two geodynamic subduction models that are based on plate motion reconstructions. We find systematically low intermediate-wavelength correlation between tomography and convective reconstruction models and suggest that the inadequate treatment of the details of slab advection is responsible. However, we confirm the presence of stable, slab-like fast anomalies in the mid-mantle whose geographic pattern naturally associates them with subduction. This finding, in addition to our analysis of heterogeneity spectra and the absence of strong minima in the radial correlation functions besides the one at similar to 700 km, supports the idea of whole mantle convection with slab penetration through the 660 km phase transition, possibly accompanied by a reorganization of flow.},

Azimuthal anisotropy in the oceanic lithosphere and asthenosphere can be imaged by surface waves and should be particularly straightforward to relate to well-understood plate kinematics and large-scale mantle flow. However, previous studies have come to mixed conclusions as to the depth extent of the applicability of paleo-spreading and mantle flow models of anisotropy, and no simple, globally valid, relationships exist. Here, we show that lattice preferred orientation (LPO) inferred from mantle flow computations produces a plausible global background model for asthenospheric anisotropy underneath oceanic lithosphere. The same is not true for absolute plate motion (APM) models. A {$\sim$}200km thick layer where the flow model LPO matches observations from tomography lies just below the {$\sim$}1200. {$^\circ$}C isotherm of a half-space cooling model, indicating strong temperature-dependence of the processes that control the development of azimuthal anisotropy. We infer that the depth extent of shear, and hence the thickness of a relatively strong oceanic lithosphere, can be mapped this way. These findings for the background model, and ocean-basin specific deviations from the half-space cooling pattern, are found in all of the three recent and independent tomographic models considered. Further exploration of deviations from the background model may be useful for general studies of oceanic plate formation and dynamics as well as regional-scale tectonic analyses. {\copyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Vertical equilibrium (VE) models are computationally efficient and have been widely used for modeling fluid migration in the subsurface. However, they rely on the assumption of instant gravity segregation of the two fluid phases which may not be valid especially for systems that have very slow drainage at low wetting phase saturations. In these cases, the time scale for the wetting phase to reach vertical equilibrium can be several orders of magnitude larger than the time scale of interest, rendering conventional VE models unsuitable. Here we present a pseudo-VE model that relaxes the assumption of instant segregation of the two fluid phases by applying a pseudo-residual saturation inside the plume of the injected fluid that declines over time due to slow vertical drainage. This pseudo-VE model is cast in a multiscale framework for vertically integrated models with the vertical drainage solved as a fine-scale problem. Two types of finescale models are developed for the vertical drainage, which lead to two pseudo-VE models. Comparisons with a conventional VE model and a full multidimensional model show that the pseudo-VE models have much wider applicability than the conventional VE model while maintaining the computational benefit of the conventional VE model.},

  abstract = {We construct a 1-D steady state channel flow model for grain size evolution in the oceanic upper mantle using a composite diffusion--dislocation creep rheology. Grain size evolution is calculated assuming that grain size is controlled by a competition between dynamic recrystallization and grain growth. Applying this grain size evolution model to the oceanic upper mantle we calculate grain size as a function of depth, seafloor age, and mantle water content. The resulting grain size structure is used to predict shear-wave velocity (VS) and seismic quality factor (Q). For a plate age of 60 Myr and an olivine water content of 1000 H/106Si, we find that grain size reaches a minimum of {$\sim$}15 mm at {$\sim$}150 km depth and then increases to {$\sim$}20--30 mm at a depth of 400 km. This grain size structure produces a good fit to the low seismic shear-wave velocity zone (LVZ) in oceanic upper mantle observed by surface wave studies assuming that the influence of hydrogen on anelastic behavior is similar to that observed for steady state creep. Further it predicts a viscosity of {$\sim$}1019 Pa{$\cdot$}s at 150 km depth and dislocation creep to be the dominant deformation mechanism throughout the oceanic upper mantle, consistent with geophysical observations. We predict larger grain sizes than proposed in recent studies, in which the LVZ was explained by a dry mantle and a minimum grain size of 1 mm. However, we show that for a 1 mm grain size, diffusion creep is the dominant deformation mechanism above 100--200 km depth, inconsistent with abundant observations of seismic anisotropy from surface wave studies. We therefore conclude that a combination of grain size evolution and a hydrated upper mantle is the most likely explanation for both the isotropic and anisotropic seismic structure of the oceanic upper mantle. Our results also suggest that melt extraction from the mantle will be significantly more efficient than predicted in previous modeling studies that assumed grain sizes of {$\sim$}1 mm.},

A range of observations suggest that slabs may be weak, implying a more prominent role for plate interface dissipation than previously thought. The shallow thrust interface is commonly assumed to be weak due to an abundance of fluids and near-lithostatic pore fluid pressures, but little attention has been paid to the influence of the deeper, viscous interface. Here we show that the deep interface viscosity in subduction zones is strongly affected by the relative proportions of sedimentary to mafic rocks that are subducted to depth. Where sediments on the down-going plate are sparse, the deep interface is dominated by mafic lithologies that metamorphose to eclogites, which exhibit viscosities 1--2 orders of magnitude higher than the asthenospheric mantle, and reduce subduction plate speeds. In contrast, where sediments are abundant and subducted to depth, the deep interface viscosity is 1--2 orders of magnitude lower than the asthenospheric mantle, thus allowing significantly faster plate velocities. This correlation between subduction plate speed and deep sediment subduction may help explain dramatic accelerations (or decelerations) in convergence rates, such as the acceleration documented for India--Asia convergence during the mid-Cenozoic.},

To date, natural and experimentally hydrated olivines have been analyzed by uncalibrated spectroscopic methods with large ({\textpm}100\%) uncertainties in accuracy. We determined the hydrogen contents of three natural olivines by 15N nuclear reaction analysis and used the results to calibrate the common infrared (IR) spectroscopic method for quantitative hydrogen analysis of olivine. OH content (expressed as parts per million H2O by weight) is 0.188 times the total integrated absorbance of the fundamental OH stretching bands in the 3750\&\#8211;3100 cm\&\#8722;1 region. The results indicate that an upward revision of some previous determinations by factors of between 2 and 4 is necessary. The most hydrous naturally occurring mantle-derived olivine analyzed to date contains 240 ppm wt. H2O. Retrospective application of this calibration to experimentally hydrated olivines may be limited by spectral differences in some cases and by the previous use of nonpolarized IR spectra.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY             Numerous processes such as metamorphic reactions, fluid and melt transfer and earthquakes occur at a subducting zone, but are still incompletely understood. These processes are affected, or even controlled, by the magnitude and distribution of stress and deformation mechanism. To eventually understand subduction zone processes, we quantify here stresses and deformation mechanisms in and around a subducting lithosphere, surrounded by asthenosphere and overlain by an overriding plate. We use two-dimensional thermo-mechanical numerical simulations based on the finite difference and marker-in-cell method and consider a 3200~km wide and 660~km deep numerical domain with a resolution of 1~km by 1~km. We apply a combined visco-elasto-plastic deformation behaviour using a linear combination of diffusion creep, dislocation creep and Peierls creep for the viscous deformation. We consider two end-member subduction scenarios: forced and free subduction. In the forced scenario, horizontal velocities are applied to the lateral boundaries of the plates during the entire simulation. In the free scenario, we set the horizontal boundary velocities to zero once the subducted slab is long enough to generate a slab pull force large enough to maintain subduction without horizontal boundary velocities. A slab pull of at least 1.8 TN m-1 is required to continue subduction in the free scenario. We also quantify along-profile variations of gravitational potential energy (GPE). We evaluate the contributions of topography and density variations to GPE variations across a subduction system. The GPE variations indicate large-scale horizontal compressive forces around the trench region and extension forces on both sides of the trench region. Corresponding vertically-averaged differential stresses are between 120 and 170~MPa. Furthermore, we calculate the distribution of the dominant deformation mechanisms. Elasto-plastic deformation is the dominant mechanism in the upper region of the lithosphere and subducting slab (from ca. 5 to 60~km depth from the top of the slab). Viscous deformation dominates in the lower region of the lithosphere and in the asthenosphere. Considering elasticity in the calculations has an important impact on the magnitude and distribution of deviatoric stress; hence, simulations with increased shear modulus, in order to reduce elasticity, exhibit considerably different stress fields. Limiting absolute stress magnitudes by decreasing the internal friction angle causes slab detachment so that slab pull cannot be transmitted anymore to the horizontal lithosphere. Applying different boundary conditions shows that forced subduction simulations are stronger affected by the applied boundary conditions than free subduction simulations. We also compare our modelled topography and gravity anomaly with natural data of seafloor bathymetry and free-air gravity anomalies across the Mariana trench. Elasticity and deviatoric stress magnitudes of several hundreds of MPa are required to best fit the natural data. This agreement suggests that the modelled flexural behaviour and density field are compatible with natural data. Moreover, we discuss potential applications of our results to the depth of faulting in a subducting plate and to the generation of petit-spot volcanoes.},

  abstract = {We present three 3D numerical models of deep subduction where buoyant material from an oceanic plateau and a plume interact with the overriding plate to assess the influence on subduction dynamics, trench geometry, and mechanisms for plateau accretion and continental growth. Transient instabilities of the convergent margin are produced, resulting in: contorted trench geometry; trench migration parallel with the plate margin; folding of the subducting slab and orocline development at the convergent margin; and transfer of the plateau to the overriding plate. The presence of plume material beneath the oceanic plateau causes flat subduction above the plume, resulting in a ``bowed'' shaped subducting slab. In plateau-only models, plateau accretion at the edge of the overriding plate results in trench migration around the edge of the plateau before subduction is re-established directly behind the trailing edge of the plateau. The plateau shortens and some plateau material subducts. The presence of buoyant plume material beneath the oceanic plateau has a profound influence on the behaviour of the convergent margin. In the plateau~+~plume model, plateau accretion causes rapid trench advance. Plate convergence is accommodated by shearing at the base of the plateau and shortening in the overriding plate. The trench migrates around the edge of the plateau and subduction is re-established well behind the trailing edge of the plateau, effectively embedding the plateau into the overriding plate. A slab window forms beneath the accreted plateau and plume material is transferred from the subducting plate to the overriding plate through the window. In all of the models, the subduction zone maintains a relatively stable configuration away from the buoyancy anomalies within the downgoing plate. The models provide a dynamic context for plateau and plume accretion in Phanerozoic accretionary orogenic systems such as the East China Orogen and the Central Asian Orogen (Altiads), which are characterised by accreted ophiolite complexes with diverse geochemical affinities, and a protracted evolution of accretion of exotic terranes including oceanic plateau and terranes with plume origins.},

Numerical models show that asthenospheric shear can be deflected upward by lateral viscosity variations within the asthenosphere, producing \&\#8220;shear-driven upwelling\&\#8221; (SDU). To constrain the rate, duration, and surface expression of intraplate volcanism caused by SDU, we simulate 2-D flow and peridotite melting in the upper 200 km of the mantle. Asthenospheric shear is driven by lithospheric plates with different thicknesses moving at 3\&\#8211;9 cm/yr, and the initial low-viscosity region is a rectangularly shaped pocket with an imposed viscosity that is 2 orders of magnitude smaller than the surrounding asthenosphere. Melting decreases as the pocket deforms and reaches steady state after 3\&\#8211;12 Myr. The age progression of surface volcanism is nearly stationary in the reference frame of the plate, which distinguishes SDU from hot spot volcanism. Similar behavior occurs if the viscosity heterogeneity is induced by variations in the water content of mantle peridotite. If the pocket's low viscosity is caused by excess temperature, buoyant upwelling of the entire pocket dominates volcanism. Differences in the time dependence of volcanism associated with damp and warm pockets may help identify which type of mantle heterogeneity and associated dynamic process best explains weak, intermittent, intraplate volcanism with no obvious age progression. We suggest that asthenospheric shear induced by plate motions and global mantle flow, by exciting SDU, drives some of the non\&\#8211;hot spot small-scale volcanism that occurs away from plate boundaries.},

The relationship between density distributions in oceanic lithosphere and the depth of melting at spreading centres is investigated by calculating the mineral proportions and densities of residual mantle depleted by extraction of melt fractions. The density changes related to compositional gradients are comparable to those produced by thermal effects for lithosphere formed from a mantle which is 200\&deg;C or more hotter than modern upper mantle. Archaean tectonics could have been dominated by spreading rates 2-3 times greater than now and with mantle temperatures between ca. 1600\&deg;C and 1800\&deg;c at the depth of the solidus.

We present a new approach for chronology building (called \${\textbackslash}backslash\$Bacon") that has received enthusiastic attention by paleoecologists. Our methodology is based on controlling core accumulation rates using a gamma au- toregressive semiparametric model with an arbitrary number of subdivisions along the sediment. Using prior knowledge about accumulation rates is crucial and in- formative priors are routinely used. Since many sediment cores are currently ana- lyzed, using di{\textregistered}erent data sets and prior distributions, a robust (adaptive) MCMC is very useful. We use the t-walk (Christen and Fox, 2010), a self adjusting, robust MCMC sampling algorithm, that works acceptably well in many situations. Out- liers are also addressed using a recent approach that considers a Student-t model for radiocarbon data. Two examples are presented here, that of a peat core and a core from a lake, and our results are compared with other approaches.},

  abstract = {A new approach to the topographic correction for terrestrial heat flow measurements is presented. The approach features calculation of a Fourier series fit to the surface temperature-surface evaluation data where the surface temperatures are based on a model that includes surface temperature variations due to microclimate variations. The mathematics of the terrain correction problem are similar to the upward (away from source) continuation problem in gravity and magnetics so several solutions, in addition to the Fourier series approach, are available in the literature that allow an accurate calculation of the correction provided the surface boundary condition is properly specified. However, the usual boundary condition applied, a linear relation between ground surface temperature and elevation, is shown to be inadequate for drill holes in the depth range 30-200 m no matter how low the topographic relief. Thus a model of ground surface temperature is developed that includes the effects of elevation, slope orientation, and slope angle. Because of the effects of microclimate, the classical models that have isothermal surfaces that generally parallel the topographic surface are significantly in error in many cases, and the patterns of isotherms near the topographic surface are more complicated than was previously recognized. This complexity causes gradient variations with depth in 30- to 200-m holes that have not been previously recognized as being related to topographic effects. Because the temperature effects of slope orientation and inclination do not scale with respect to the magnitude of the relief, significant terrain corrections may be required even in areas of relatively low relief. The application of the technique is illustrated by application to a line dipole hill and a group of drill holes near Wilbur, Washington. In addition, several examples of two-dimensional terrain effects and one example of three-dimensional terrain effects are illustrated for topographic sections in the northwestern United States. In the United States, most 'anomalous' gradients in the upper 100-200 m of drill holes in impermeable rocks can be explained by a combination of topographic and microclimatic effects, without resorting to temporal climatic changes or unknown types of water effects. The depth of the holes necessary for reliable heat flow measurements in such settings is a signal to noise problem where the noise is the effect at depth of the microclimatically related surface temperature variations, coupled with the topographic effect, and the signal is a temperature increase at any depth due to the background geothermal gradient. Typically, the noise has decreased to a few degrees centigrade per kilometer within the depth range 100-200 m. Thus the general conclusion has been that these depths of holes are required for reliable heat flow values. In fact, when linear temperature-depth data are observed in shallower holes or when appropriate corrections are made, reliable measurements in impermeable rocks may be consistently made in holes no deeper than 100 m.},

The maar volcanoes under investigation include the Ecklin and Anakie maars, and the Red Rock and Mount Leura Volcanic Complexes, which vary in their complexity, morphology, eruptive styles and host rock type. The Ecklin and Anakie maars display relatively simple geophysical signatures. Long wavelength gravity lows with corresponding magnetic highs are observed across the craters and were reproduced' during modelling with the presence of a shallow maar-diatreme at Anakie and two coalesced diatremes containing denser central vents at Ecklin. Red Rock and Mount Leura have more complex geophysical signatures, consisting of short wavelength gravity and magnetic highs superimposed on longer wavelength gravity lows. These anomalies are reproduced during modelling with coalesced 'bowl shaped' diatremes containing dykes and magma ponds. The complex diatreme geometries revealed from forward and inverse modelling suggest that the eruption histories of these volcanoes are more complex than their morphology would suggest. Multiple coalesced diatreme structures indicate an eruption involving vent migration, while preserved dykes within the diatreme suggest short-lived fluctuations between phreatomagmatic and magmatic eruption styles. The geometry of the diatremes is consistent with maars hosted in a soft-substrate, which likely contributed to the migration of vents observed at Ecklin, Red Rock, and Mt Leura. The shallow diatreme observed within the Anakie maar is attributed to a short-lived eruption and low water content within the granitic host rock. {\copyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Fractures in a rock mass influence the traveltimes and amplitudes of seismic waves that have propagated through them. The displacement discontinuity model, recently employed in fracture investigations, is modified to describe the effect of fractures on seismic-wave velocity and attenuation. This new model, the modified displacement discontinuity model (MDD), is formulated in a way analogous to transmission-line analysis. The fractures are treated as transmission lines for the passage of seismic waves. The MDD takes into consideration realistic fracture parameters which include the fracture length, the fractional area of a fracture surface in contact, and the nature of the infilling material. A single fracture of varying geometric and material properties is shown to affect dramatically the transmission properties of a propagating waveform, and hence the seismic velocity and attenuation. These effects have been shown to result in a frequency-dependent velocity and attenuation. The sensitivity of the fracture parameters to seismic-wave velocity and attenuation was investigated and interesting results were obtained. Fracture parameters used in designing experimental models consisting of synthetically manufactured cracks were fed into the MDD and a well-known crack model, Hudson's model, for comparison. Velocities as a function of the incident-wave angle were obtained from both numerical models and were compared with the results from the experimental modelling. For P waves, the MDD model results show better agreement with those of the experimental model for all crack densities investigated than those from Hudson's model.},

Those models physically link mantle dynamics to surface tectonics. Combined with plate tectonic reconstructions, they have the potential to produce a new generation of mantle circulation models that use data assimilation methods and where uncertainties in plate tectonic reconstructions are taken into account. We provided a proof of this concept by applying a suboptimal Kalman filter to the reconstruction of mantle circulation (Bocher et al., 2016). Here, we propose to go one step further and apply the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) to this problem. The EnKF is a sequential Monte Carlo method particularly adapted to solve high-dimensional data assimilation problems with nonlinear dynamics. We tested the EnKF using synthetic observations consisting of surface velocity and heat flow measurements on a 2-D-spherical annulus model and compared it with the method developed previously. The EnKF performs on average better and is more stable than the former method. Less than 300 ensemble members are sufficient to reconstruct an evolution. We use covariance adaptive inflation and localization to correct for sampling errors. We show that the EnKF results are robust over a wide range of covariance localization parameters. The reconstruction is associated with an estimation of the error, and provides valuable information on where the reconstruction is to be trusted or not.},

  abstract = {With the progress of mantle convection modelling over the last decade, it now becomes possible to solve for the dynamics of the interior flow and the surface tectonics to first order. We show here that tectonic data (like surface kinematics and seafloor age distribution) and mantle convection models with plate-like behaviour can in principle be combined to reconstruct mantle convection. We present a sequential data assimilation method, based on suboptimal schemes derived from the Kalman filter, where surface velocities and seafloor age maps are not used as boundary conditions for the flow, but as data to assimilate. Two stages (a forecast followed by an analysis) are repeated sequentially to take into account data observed at different times. Whenever observations are available, an analysis infers the most probable state of the mantle at this time, considering a prior guess (supplied by the forecast) and the new observations at hand, using the classical best linear unbiased estimate. Between two observation times, the evolution of the mantle is governed by the forward model of mantle convection. This method is applied to synthetic 2-D spherical annulus mantle cases to evaluate its efficiency. We compare the reference evolutions to the estimations obtained by data assimilation. Two parameters control the behaviour of the scheme: the time between two analyses, and the amplitude of noise in the synthetic observations. Our technique proves to be efficient in retrieving temperature field evolutions provided the time between two analyses is 10 Myr. If the amplitude of the a priori error on the observations is large (30 per cent), our method provides a better estimate of surface tectonics than the observations, taking advantage of the information within the physics of convection.},

  abstract = {Interpolation of spatial data is a widely used technique across the Earth sciences. For example, the thickness of the crust can be estimated by different active and passive seismic source surveys, and seismologists reconstruct the topography of the Moho by interpolating these different estimates. Although much research has been done on improving the quantity and quality of observations, the interpolation algorithms utilized often remain standard linear regression schemes, with three main weaknesses: (1) the level of structure in the surface, or smoothness, has to be predefined by the user; (2) different classes of measurements with varying and often poorly constrained uncertainties are used together, and hence it is difficult to give appropriate weight to different data types with standard algorithms; (3) there is typically no simple way to propagate uncertainties in the data to uncertainty in the estimated surface. Hence the situation can be expressed by Mackenzie (2004): ``We use fantastic telescopes, the best physical models, and the best computers. The weak link in this chain is interpreting our data using 100 year old mathematics''. Here we use recent developments made in Bayesian statistics and apply them to the problem of surface reconstruction. We show how the reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (rj-McMC) algorithm can be used to let the degree of structure in the surface be directly determined by the data. The solution is described in probabilistic terms, allowing uncertainties to be fully accounted for. The method is illustrated with an application to Moho depth reconstruction in Australia.}

  abstract = {Transmission electron microscopy observations on olivine crystals deformed at moderate ({$\leq$}1273 K) temperature evidenced dislocations interactions explaining the hardening observed in the experiments, but also recovery mechanisms by the absorption or emission of point defects. Thus we investigate the possibility that, at geological strain-rates, these recovery processes allow steady-state deformation by dislocation creep at low to moderate temperatures in the lithospheric mantle. We test this hypothesis using a 2.5-D dislocation dynamics (DD) model, which combines dislocation glide and recovery by climb. This model shows that diffusion-controlled recovery processes allow for steady-state deformation by dislocation creep in the lithospheric mantle at stresses {\textbackslash}textless500 MPa. For stresses of 50-200 MPa, steady-state strain-rates of 10-15s-1may be attained at temperatures as low as 900 K. Fitting of the DD model produces a flow law, which represents a lower bound for the lithospheric mantle strength, since the models describe the deformation of an olivine single crystal in an easy slip orientation. Comparison of strain-rates and Moho temperatures inferred for different geodynamic environments and the predictions of this model-based flow law implies, nevertheless, that, except in incipient rifts, most of the observed deformation may be produced by stress levels {$\leq$}200 MPa, consistent with those inferred to be produced by convection. This convergence suggests that the present models, which explicitly calculate the time-dependent dislocation dynamics, may provide a correct first order estimate of the mechanical behaviour of the lithospheric mantle, which cannot be derived directly from any existing data.},

Anorogenic igneous provinces accompany continental break-up and predate the development of new oceanic basins. Though not voluminous compared with the other granite types, A-type granites substantiate critical periods of the life of supercontinents. Their ages of emplacement in the Variscan-Alpine Europe span the entire Cambrian-Triassic time interval. They are not random, however, and correspond to discrete episodes. Two major age groupings, both with a c. 60 My duration, are distinguished. The Early Cambrian-Early Ordovician period corresponds to Pannotia amalgamation, followed by its break-up and the development of the Rheic-Proto-Tethys Ocean. The Late Carboniferous-Early Triassic period corresponds to Rheic closure and Pangaea amalgamation, followed by its break-up and the development of the Neo-Tethys Ocean. Devonian-Early Carboniferous A-type igneous episodes, scarce in Europe but widespread in Central Asia, accompanied the development of the Palaeo-Tethys Ocean.},

This selection includes minimum distance, flatness, smoothness and compactness constraints, which can be combined using a Lagrangian formulation. A multigrid technique is also implemented to resolve separately large and short gravity wavelengths. The subsurface in the survey area is divided into rectangular prismatic blocks and the problem is solved by calculating the model parameters, i.e. the densities of each block. Weights are given to each block depending on depth, a priori information on density and the density range allowed for the region under investigation. The present computer code is tested on modelled data for a dipping dike and multiple bodies. Results combining different constraints and a weight depending on depth are shown for the dipping dike. The advantages and behaviour of each method are compared in the 3D reconstruction. Recovery of geometry (depth, size) and density distribution of the original model is dependent on the set of constraints used. From experimentation, the best combination of constraints for multiple bodies seems to be flatness and a minimum volume for the multiple bodies. The inversion method is tested on real gravity data from the Rouyn-Noranda (Quebec) mining camp. The 3D inversion model for the first 10 km is in agreement with the known major lithological contacts at the surface; it enables the determination of the geometry of plutons and intrusive rocks at depth.},

It was formerly believed that Great Britain and Ireland was largely ice free between the last interglacial (oxygen isotope sub-stage 5e) and the Late Devensian, when the LGM occurred. As such the BIIS was effectively out of phase with Laurentide and Scandinavian ice sheets, as well as inferences of ice volume from oxygen isotope stratigraphy. The BIIS during the Late Devensian maximum was also perceived as having been relatively stationary. New evidence shows that the LGM was an important event during the evolution of an earlier BIIS when the extent of ice was greater. Repeated iceberg rafting events over the past 50 ka are shown by marine cores, while the derivative inference of numerous corresponding glacial advances is supported by several clusters of Cl-36 ages on glaciated surfaces and glacial boulders, that are indicative of deglacial events between 40 and 12 ka. These appear to be associated with Heinrich events, the earliest being inferred as Heinrich 4 at about 40 ka. During this advance, the BIIS and Scandinavian Ice Sheet (SIS) were in contact and all of Ireland was glaciated. The ice sheet appears to have fluctuated several times between 40 and 25 ka, although evidence for this is poorly preserved. But the Cl-36 and C-14 evidence is clear that the BIIS reached its LGM maximum size about 22 ka, soon after Heinrich Event 2, when the BIIS and SIS were not in contact. One cluster of Cl-36 and C-14 ages, at 21.4 +/- 1.3 ka, records an initial pulse of deglaciation that was followed by extensive deglaciation about 17.4 +/- 0.4 ka, just before Heinrich Event 1, when the ice sheet readvanced. Contrary to previous views, the BITS probably existed throughout much of Devensian time as a mobile and sensitive ice sheet, during which the LGM advance was but one important event. In places, glacial deposits of the earlier Devensian glaciation have previously been incorrectly identified as products of the later LGM glaciation. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Through the solution of the convection equations, the models honor geophysical and geological data near the surface while predicting mantle flow and structure at depth and associated surface deformation. The methods consist of four constraints determined a priori from a plate history model: (1) plate velocities, (2) thermal structure of the lithosphere, (3) thermal structure of slabs in the upper mantle, and (4) velocity of slabs in the upper mantle. These constraints are implemented as temporally- and spatially-dependent conditions that are blended with the solution of the convection equations at each time step. We construct Earth-like regional models with oceanic and continental lithosphere, trench migration, oblique subduction, and asymmetric subduction to test the robustness of the methods by computing the temperature, velocity, and buoyancy flux of the lithosphere and slab. Full sphere convection models demonstrate how the methods can determine the flow associated with specific tectonic environments (e.g., back-arc basins, intraoceanic subduction zones) to address geological questions and compare with independent data, both at present-day and in the geological past (e.g., seismology, residual topography, stratigraphy). Using global models with paleogeographical constraints we demonstrate (1) subduction initiation at the Izu--Bonin--Mariana convergent margin and flat slab subduction beneath North America, (2) enhanced correlation of model slabs and fast anomalies in seismic tomography beneath North and South America, and (3) comparable amplitude of dynamic and residual topography in addition to improved spatial correlation of dynamic and residual topography lows.},

  abstract = {One of the most complex and contentious issues in Australian ecology concerns the environmental impact of Aboriginal landscape burning. This issue is not only important for the development of a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics and evolution of the Australian biota, but is central to the formulation of appropriate strategies for the conservation of the nation's biodiversity. Ethnographic evidence leaves little doubt that Aboriginal burning played a central role in the maintenance of the landscapes subsequently colonized by Europeans. Both 19th century European colonists and anthropologists in the 20th century documented the indispensability of fire as a tool in traditional Aboriginal economies, which have aptly been described as `fire-stick farming'. Aborigines used fire to achieve short-term outcomes such as providing favourable habitats for herbivores or increasing the local abundance of food plants, but it is not clear whether or not Aborigines had a predictive ecological knowledge of the long-term consequences of their use of fire. A large body of ecological evidence suggests that Aboriginal burning resulted in substantial changes in the geographic range and demographic structure of many vegetation types. Aboriginal burning was important in creating habitat mosaics that favoured the abundance of some mammal species and in the maintenance of infrequently burnt habitats upon which the survival of specialized fauna depends. Aboriginal fire regimes were probably critical for the maintenance of at least one species of tree (Callitris intratropica) in the monsoon tropics. The question of the original impact of humans on the Australian environment is fundamentally speculative because of vague, disputed time frames proposed for the waves of colonization and shifting settlement patterns of Aborigines in the late Quaternary period. There is an inherent circular argument concerning the cause and effect of climate change, vegetation change, and burning through the late Quaternary. Charcoal and pollen evidence from long sedimentary cores is ambiguous and cannot be used to demonstrate unequivocally the initial impact of Aboriginal people on the landscapes of Pleistocene Australia. The sparse available evidence does not support the hypotheses that Aboriginal burning was primarily responsible for the extinction of Pleistocene megafauna; was critical for the maintenance of habitats of small mammals that have become extinct following European colonization; initiated widespread accelerated soil erosion rates in either the Pleistocene or Holocene; or forced the evolutionary diversification of the Australian biota. Burning may have caused the extinction of some fire-sensitive species of plants and animals dependent upon infrequently burnt habitats, and it must have maintained structurally open vegetation such as grasslands and also extended the range of fire-adapted species, such as Eucalyptus, into environments climatically suitable for rain forest. Palaeoecological research concerning prior impacts of Aborigines must give way to focused studies of the role of different anthropogenic fire regimes in contemporary ecosystems that have not been destroyed by European colonization. Such research is crucial for comprehending the role of Aboriginal burning in the maintenance of Australia's unique, rich biodiversity.},

  abstract = {We present the first-generation global tomographic model constructed based on adjoint tomography, an iterative full-waveform inversion technique. Synthetic seismograms were calculated using GPU-accelerated spectral-element simulations of global seismic wave propagation, accommodating effects due to 3-D anelastic crust \& mantle structure, topography \& bathymetry, the ocean load, ellipticity, rotation, and self-gravitation. Fr{\'e}chet derivatives were calculated in 3-D anelastic models based on an adjoint-state method. The simulations were performed on the Cray XK7 named `Titan', a computer with 18 688 GPU accelerators housed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The transversely isotropic global model is the result of 15 tomographic iterations, which systematically reduced differences between observed and simulated three-component seismograms. Our starting model combined 3-D mantle model S362ANI with 3-D crustal model Crust2.0. We simultaneously inverted for structure in the crust and mantle, thereby eliminating the need for widely used `crustal corrections'. We used data from 253 earthquakes in the magnitude range 5.8 {$\leq$} Mw {$\leq$} 7.0. We started inversions by combining {$\sim$}30 s body-wave data with {$\sim$}60 s surface-wave data. The shortest period of the surface waves was gradually decreased, and in the last three iterations we combined {$\sim$}17 s body waves with {$\sim$}45 s surface waves. We started using 180 min long seismograms after the 12th iteration and assimilated minor- and major-arc body and surface waves. The 15th iteration model features enhancements of well-known slabs, an enhanced image of the Samoa/Tahiti plume, as well as various other plumes and hotspots, such as Caroline, Galapagos, Yellowstone and Erebus. Furthermore, we see clear improvements in slab resolution along the Hellenic and Japan Arcs, as well as subduction along the East of Scotia Plate, which does not exist in the starting model. Point-spread function tests demonstrate that we are approaching the resolution of continental-scale studies in some areas, for example, underneath Yellowstone. This is a consequence of our multiscale smoothing strategy in which we define our smoothing operator as a function of the approximate Hessian kernel, thereby smoothing gradients less wherever we have good ray coverage, such as underneath North America.},

  abstract = {Resolution in seismic tomography intimately depends on data coverage, with different parts of seismograms sensitive to different parts of Earth's structure. In classical seismic tomography, the usable amount of data is often restricted because of approximations to the wave equation. 3-D numerical simulations of wave propagation provide new opportunities for increasing the amount of usable data in seismograms by choosing appropriate misfit functions which have direct control on Fr{\'e}chet derivatives. We propose new misfit functions for full waveform tomography based on instantaneous phase differences and envelope ratios between observed and synthetic seismograms. The aim is to extract as much information as possible from a single seismogram. Using the properties of the Hilbert transform, we separate phase and amplitude information in the time domain. To gain insight in the advantages and disadvantages of chosen misfit functions, we make qualitative comparisons of the corresponding finite-frequency adjoint sensitivity kernels with those from commonly used misfit functions based on cross-correlation traveltime, amplitude and waveform differences. The major advantages of our misfit functions are: (1) working in the Hilbert domain reduces non-linear behaviour of waveforms due to interaction of phase and amplitude information, and (2) we show with noise-free synthetic seismograms that it is possible to use a complete seismogram without losing information from low-amplitude phases. Complementary to instantaneous phase measurements, envelope measurements provide a way of using amplitude information of waveforms, which may also easily be extended to constrain anelastic properties. The properties of the kernels allow us to simplify the tomography problem by separating elastic and anelastic inversions. First indications are that the kernels remain well behaved in the presence of noise.},

However, until now there has been no direct evidence that the mouse node organizes pattern during gastrulation, nor that the exceptionally small mouse embryonic egg cylinder can be induced to form a second axis. Grafts of transgenically marked midgastrulation mouse node, or node labelled with DiI, to a posterolateral location in a host embryo of the same developmental stage results in the induction of a second neural axis and the formation of ectopic somites. The graft gives rise predominantly to notochord and endoderm tissue whereas the neurectoderm and somites are mainly of host origin. The ectopic notochord formed is derived solely from the donor node which suggests that the node can serve as a 'stem cell' source of axial mesoderm. This is corroborated by the observation that labelling in situ the population of cells on the outer surface of the mid-gastrulation node with DiI results in continuous labelling of the notochord. DiI-labelled cells are present throughout the notochord from a rostral boundary in the cranial region to its most caudal extreme and the node itself always remains labelled.},

Comparison of the fracture strengths at different pore pressures provided a test of the law of effective stress for these brittle rocks. The tests revealed that the law of effective stress held for these rocks only when loading rate was less than some critical value which depended on permeability of the rock, viscosity of the pore fluid and sample geometry. In our experiments with water, it was about 10-7 sec-1 for cylindrical samples of granite several centimeters long for example. In experiments at loading rates greater than the critical value, the rock was as much as 50 per cent stronger than at zero pore pressure. Although this effect will probably have little geological application, it could well be significant for rock stressed as a result of earthquake motion or for rock in the vicinity of buried nuclear explosions.}

In the east, these regions coincide with the regions of maximum topography, suggesting that, if this uplift rate is long-term, up to 50\% of the present-day topographic relief in the southeastern Highlands and Flinders Ranges has formed in the last 10 Ma, i.e. the time we estimate for the onset of the present-day stress field experienced by the Indo-Australian Plate. These estimates are supported by fission-track data from the Snowy Mountains, which indicate that a non-negligible proportion of the present-day relief is the remnant of a much older topography formed during the various accretion or breakup events along the eastern margin of the continent in Late Paleozoic to Early Mesozoic time and that younger relief growth (i.e. younger than 100 Ma) must be limited to less than a kilometer in amplitude. By contrast, in the western part of the continent no such correlation exists between present-day topography and uplift predicted by integrating seismic strain rate over 10 Ma. This suggests that the apparently high level of seismic activity observed in the southwestern part of the Yilgarn Craton and along Proterozoic mobile belts, such as the Albany--Fraser Province of southeastern Western Australia and the Fitzroy Trough of northern Western Australia, is transient or that, contrary to what is happening in the east, erosional processes are able to remove surface relief created at the relatively slow rate of 10 m/Ma, potentially because there existed no finite amplitude topography prior to the onset of the present-day compressional stress field.},

Using simple scaling arguments, as well as a very efficient surface processes model, we show that dynamic topography erodes in direct proportion to its wavelength.

However, mounting evidence indicates that a significant proportion of Earth's topography results from the viscous stresses created by flow within the underlying mantle, rather than by the moving plates. This dynamic topography is transient, varying as mantle flow changes, and is characterized by small amplitudes and long wavelengths. It is therefore often hidden by or confused with the more obvious topographic anomalies resulting from horizontal tectonic move- ments. However, dynamic topography can influence surface processes and thus enter the geological record; it has, for example, played a role in the establishment of Amazon drainage patterns. In turn, surface processes such as the erosion of topographical anomalies could affect mantle flow. This emerging view of dynamic topography suggests that the concept of plate tectonics as the driver of surface deformation needs to be extended to include the vertical coupling between the mantle and the surface. Unravelling this coupling back in time with the help of models and the geological record can potentially provide unprecedented insights into past mantle dynamics.},

The algorithm has great geometrical flexibility, which makes it possible to solve problems involving complex boundaries, radially symmetrical uplift functions and horizontal tectonic transport across strike-slip faults. The algorithm is also ideally suited for problems which require large variations in spatial discretization and/or self-adaptive meshing. We present a number of examples to illustrate the power of the new approach and its advantages over more `classical' models based on regular (rectangular) discretization. We also demonstrate that the synthetic river networks and landscapes generated by the model obey the laws of network composition and have scaling properties similar to those of natural landscapes.

The method is based on a mixed Eulerian-Lagrangian approach that requires frequent re-interpolation of the temperature field in the vertical direction to ensure accuracy. From the computed crustal thermal structure, the temperature history of rock particles that, following an imposed tectonic scenario, are exhumed at the Earth's surface, is derived. These T-t paths can then be used to compute apparent isotopic ages for a range of geochronometers. The usefulness of the code is demonstrated by computing the predicted distribution of (U-Th)/He apatite ages in a high relief area of the Sierra Nevada, California, for a range of tectonic scenarios and comparing them to existing data. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The results show that recent relief changes strongly affect the distribution of ages with elevation (notably the slope of the age-elevation relationship). The calculations presented here predict that, in most situations, regions that have undergone a steady decrease in surface relief in the recent past should be characterized by an inverted age-elevation relationship, that is older ages should be found near valley bottoms and younger ages near summit tops.

The algorithm is highly efficient because computation time increases linearly with the number of points used to discretize the landscape and is ideally suited to parallelization. It is also unconditionally stable because it uses an implicit scheme for the time integration of the landscape evolution equation, which means that large time steps can be used without sacrificing accuracy. In this paper we describe the algorithm and present results that demonstrate its efficiency and accuracy. {\copyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

While head data alone are often insufficient to estimate unique parameters due to model nonuniqueness, flow-and-heat-transport modeling can constrain estimation and allow simultaneous estimation of boundary fluxes and hydraulic conductivity. In this work, synthetic and field models that did not converge when head data were used did converge when head and temperature were used. Furthermore, frequency domain analyses of head and temperature data allowed selection of appropriate modeling timescales. Inflows in the Wilton, Wisconsin, wetlands could be estimated over periods such as a growing season and over periods of a few days when heads were nearly steady and groundwater temperature varied during the day. While this methodology is computationally more demanding than traditional head calibration, the results gained are unobtainable using the traditional approach. These results suggest that temperature can efficiently supplement head data in systems where accurate flux calibration targets are unavailable.},

We have interpreted over 500 km (45 lines) of an unpublished recenty reprocessed seismic dataset as a means to elucidating the evolution of both features. Major horizons observed in the seismic data have been described and correlated with significant tectonic events that shaped the formation of the greater Sydney?Gunnedah?Bowen Basin; namely Early Permian extension, mid-Permian passive thermal subsidence and Late Permian to mid-Triassic foreland loading. Horizon mapping shows that the Camden Syncline is a broad north-northeast plunging structure whose western limb is truncated by the north?south trending faults and folds of the Lapstone Structural Complex. Furthermore, isochron maps reveal that the Late Permian to mid-Triassic sedimentary succession thickens towards the axis of the Camden Syncline, thus confirming it's role as a depocentre during this period of basin evolution. No abrupt thickening is observed in the Late Permian to mid-Triassic sedimentary succession in the vicinity of the Lapstone Structural Complex indicating that the Lapstone Structural Complex was formed subsequent to the deposition of the Permian?Triassic Sydney Basin sedimentary succession. Furthermore, our interpretation of the reprocessed seismic data confirms that the major structural style of the Lapstone Structural Complex is that of west dipping reverse faults and east facing monoclines.},

The purpose of the WINCH traverse was to study crustal structure of the Caledonian foreland, to cross the Caledonian orogen, and to establish the three-dimensional geometry of mantle reflectors originally seen on MOIST. We describe here the data, first emphasizing British Caledonian structures, and then discussing features of the deep crust of wider significance. The data are of very good quality and contain clear Moho and upper mantle reflections. The lower crust is surprisingly reflective, deeply penetrative thrusts are observed and there is firm evidence that several of the Mesozoic basins round the shores of the United Kingdom were formed by reactivation of older features. {\copyright} 1983 Nature Publishing Group.}

  abstract = {Elasticity is described in general by a fourth-order tensor with 21 independent coefficients, which corresponds to the triclinic symmetry class. However seismological observations are usually explained with a higher order of symmetry using fewer parameters. We propose an analytical method to decompose the elastic tensor into a sum of orthogonal tensors belonging to the different symmetry classes. The method relies on a vectorial description of the elastic tensor. Any symmetry class constitutes a subspace of a class of lower symmetry and an orthogonal projection on this subspace removes the lower symmetry part. Orthogonal projectors on each higher symmetry class are given explicitly. In addition, the method provides optimal higher symmetry approximations, which allow us to decrease the number of independent parameters. Consequences of the symmetry approximation of the elastic tensor on shear wave splitting (SWS) are investigated for upper-mantle minerals (olivine and enstatite), natural samples and numerically deformed olivine aggregates. The orthorhombic part of the elastic tensor as well as the presence of enstatite are important second-order effects.},

  abstract = {The origin of the Newer Granites is long-standing problem. In the Caledonian orthotectonic zone the intrusions span the period of late orogenic convergence and uplift, but attempts to relate them as a group to late Iapetan subduction have been unsuccessful. A range of rock types is represented, mainly with I-type affinities, and granodiorite is the most voluminous. In contrast, granitic intrusions south of the Moniaive shear zone in Scotland and also in the north of England have significant S-type characteristics, span the trace of the Iapetus suture and have ages in the range 400--390 Ma, significantly younger than intrusions to the north. We refer to these younger granitic intrusions, along with others of similar character along-strike to the southwest, as the Trans-Suture Suite. We explore the link between the Trans-Suture Suite and recently recognized orogen-wide sinistral transtension in the Early Devonian period. Importantly, the Trans-Suture Suite intrusions are accompanied by an intense suite of lamprophyre dykes, the origin of which is to be sought in extension, decompression and heating of enriched Avalonian sub-continental lithosphere. In some instances the granite intrusions carry clots of lamprophyric origin and the Criffel body is particularly important in being continuously zoned from an I-type with lamprophyric enclaves to an S-type interior. We propose that generation of these lamprophyres during transtension advected heat into the base of the crust to produce the S-type component of the Trans-Suture Suite. Modelling presented shows that generation of voluminous S-type magmas requires the coincidence of several factors: hydrated sub-continental lithospheric mantle preserved during `soft' collision under the Trans-Suture Suite zone; thermal relaxation to remove any subduction refrigeration; crust composed of juvenile volcanogenic material; and Devonian transtension. Our models suggest that if hydration pre-dated transtension then only small granitic bodies could be produced, unless the zone of lamprophyre generation extends beyond the rift zone. The emplacement of the Trans-Suture Suite intrusions overlapped the Acadian deformation period that succeeded the transtensional episode during which the granite magmas were generated.},

It is well known that strain-rate-dependent processes control rift evolution1, 2, yet quantified extension histories of Earth's major passive margins have become available only recently. Here we investigate rift kinematics globally by applying a new geotectonic analysis technique to revised global plate reconstructions. We find that rifted margins feature an initial, slow rift phase (less than ten millimetres per year, full rate) and that an abrupt increase of plate divergence introduces a fast rift phase. Plate acceleration takes place before continental rupture and considerable margin area is created during each phase. We reproduce the rapid transition from slow to fast extension using analytical and numerical modelling with constant force boundary conditions. The extension models suggest that the two-phase velocity behaviour is caused by a rift-intrinsic strength--velocity feedback, which can be robustly inferred for diverse lithosphere configurations and rheologies. Our results explain differences between proximal and distal margin areas3 and demonstrate that abrupt plate acceleration during continental rifting is controlled by the nonlinear decay of the resistive rift strength force. This mechanism provides an explanation for several previously unexplained rapid absolute plate motion changes, offering new insights into the balance of plate driving forces through time.},

  abstract = {Rifting involves complex normal faulting that is controlled by extension direction, reactivation of prerift structures, sedimentation, and dyke dynamics. The relative impact of these factors on the observed fault pattern, however, is difficult to deduce from field-based studies alone. This study provides insight in crustal stress patterns and fault orientations by employing a laterally homogeneous, 3-D rift setup with constant extension velocity. The presented numerical forward experiments cover the whole spectrum of oblique extension. They are conducted using an elastoviscoplastic finite element model and involve crustal and mantle layers accounting for self-consistent necking of the lithosphere. Despite recent advances, 3-D numerical experiments still require relatively coarse resolution so that individual faults are poorly resolved. This issue is addressed by applying a post processing method that identifies the stress regime and preferred fault azimuth at each surface element. The simple model setup results in a surprising variety of fault orientations that are solely caused by the three-dimensionality of oblique rift systems. Depending on rift obliquity, these orientations can be grouped in terms of rift-parallel, extension-orthogonal, and intermediate normal fault directions as well as strike-slip faults. While results compare well with analog rift models of low to moderate obliquity, new insight is gained in advanced rift stages and highly oblique settings. Individual fault populations are activated in a characteristic multiphase evolution driven by lateral density variations of the evolving rift system. In natural rift systems, this pattern might be modified by additional heterogeneities, surface processes, and dyke dynamics.},

Several geometric quantities are computed from the spline fits, including the minimum radius of curvature. We also introduce a quantity called the equivalent radius of curvature to precisely define the bending dissipation in either a viscous or a plastic slab. The minimum and equivalent radius of curvature are approximately equal in slabs with simple geometry (i.e., a single bend) but deviate substantially when the geometry is more complicated. A compilation of estimates shows that the equivalent radius of curvature is insensitive to the age of the plate at the trench. Mean values are 175 km or 191 km, depending on the rheology of the slab. When bending occurs by viscous deformation, the resulting dissipation can exceed the power available from subduction with reasonable choices for viscosity. A more consistent description of the energetics is obtained by assuming a plastic rheology. Copyright 2011 by the American Geophysical Union.},

  abstract = {Bending of lithospheric plates at subduction zones is thought to be an important source of dissipation for convection in the Earth's mantle. However, the influence of bending on plate motion is uncertain. Here we use a variational description of mantle convection to show that bending strongly affects the direction of plate motion. Subduction of slabs and subsidence of oceanic lithosphere with age provide the primary driving forces. Dissipation is partitioned between plate bending and various sources of friction at plate boundaries and in the interior of the mantle due to viscous flow. We determine the poles of rotation for the Pacific and Nazca plates by requiring the net work to be stationary with respect to small changes in the direction of motion. The best fit to the observed rotation poles is obtained with an effective lithospheric viscosity of 6 {\texttimes} 1022 Pa s. Bending of the Pacific plate dissipates roughly 40\% of the energy released by subduction through the upper mantle. {\copyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {We present a computational framework for estimating the uncertainty in the numerical solution of linearized infinite-dimensional statistical inverse problems. We adopt the Bayesian inference formulation: given observational data and their uncertainty, the governing forward problem and its uncertainty, and a prior probability distribution describing uncertainty in the parameter field, find the posterior probability distribution over the parameter field. The prior must be chosen appropriately in order to guarantee well-posedness of the infinite-dimensional inverse problem and facilitate computation of the posterior. Furthermore, straightforward discretizations may not lead to convergent approximations of the infinite-dimensional problem. And finally, solution of the discretized inverse problem via explicit construction of the covariance matrix is prohibitive due to the need to solve the forward problem as many times as there are parameters. Our computational framework builds on the infinite-dimensional formulation proposed by Stuart (A. M. Stuart, Inverse problems: A Bayesian perspective, Acta Numerica, 19 (2010), pp. 451-559), and incorporates a number of components aimed at ensuring a convergent discretization of the underlying infinite-dimensional inverse problem. The framework additionally incorporates algorithms for manipulating the prior, constructing a low rank approximation of the data-informed component of the posterior covariance operator, and exploring the posterior that together ensure scalability of the entire framework to very high parameter dimensions. We demonstrate this computational framework on the Bayesian solution of an inverse problem in 3D global seismic wave propagation with hundreds of thousands of parameters.},

  abstract = {Mantle convection models require an initial condition some time in the past. Because this initial condition is unknown for Earth, we cannot infer the geological evolution of mantle flow from forward mantle convection calculations even for the most recent Mesozoic and Cenozoic geological history of our planet. Here we introduce a fluid dynamic inverse problem to constrain unknown mantle flow back in time from seismic tomographic observations of the mantle and reconstructions of past plate motions using variational data assimilation. We derive the generalized inverse of mantle convection and explore the initial condition problem in high-resolution, 3-D spherical mantle circulation models for a time period of 100 Myr, roughly comparable to half a mantle overturn. We present a synthetic modelling experiment to demonstrate that mid-Cretaceous mantle structure can be inferred accurately from fluid dynamic inverse modelling, assuming present-day mantle structure is well-known, even if an initial first guess assumption about the mid-Cretaceous mantle involved only a simple 1-D radial temperature profile. We also demonstrate that convecting present-day mantle structure back in time by reversing the time-stepping of the energy equation is insufficient to model the mantle structure of the past. The difficulty arises, because such backward convection calculations ignore thermal diffusion effects, and therefore cannot account for the generation of thermal buoyancy in boundary layers as we go back in time. Inverse mantle convection modelling should make it possible to infer a number of flow parameters from observational constraints of the mantle.},

  abstract = {The Longmen Shan region includes, from west to east, the northeastern part of the Tibetan Plateau, the Sichuan Basin, and the eastern part of the eastern Sichuan fold-and-thrust belt. In the northeast, it merges with the Micang Shan, a part of the Qinling Mountains. The Longmen Shan region can be divided into two major tectonic elements: (1) an autochthon/parautochthon, which underlies the easternmost part of the Tibetan Plateau, the Sichuan Basin, and the eastern Sichuan fold-and-thrust belt; and (2) a complex allochthon, which underlies the eastern part of the Tibetan Plateau. The allochthon was emplaced toward the southeast during Late Triassic time, and it and the western part of the autochthon/parautochthon were modified by Cenozoic deformation. The autochthon/parautochthon was formed from the western part of the Yangtze platform and consists of a Proterozoic basement covered by a thin, incomplete succession of Late Proterozoic to Middle Triassic shallow-marine and nonmarine sedimentary rocks interrupted by Permian extension and basic magmatism in the southwest. The platform is bounded by continental margins that formed in Silurian time to the west and in Late Proterozoic time to the north. Within the southwestern part of the platform is the narrow N-trending Kungdian high, a paleogeographic unit that was positive during part of Paleozoic time and whose crest is characterized by nonmarine Upper Triassic rocks unconformably overlying Proterozoic basement. In the western part of the Longmen Shan region, the allochthon is composed mainly of a very thick succession of strongly folded Middle and Upper Triassic Songpan Ganzi flysch. Along the eastern side and at the base of the allochthon, pre-Upper Triassic rocks crop out, forming the only exposures of the western margin of the Yangtze platform. Here, Upper Proterozoic to Ordovician, mainly shallow-marine rocks unconformably overlie Yangtze-type Proterozic basement rocks, but in Silurian time a thick section of fine-grained clastic and carbonate rocks were deposited, marking the initial subsidence of the western Yangtze platform and formation of a continental margin. Similar deep-water rocks were deposited throughout Devonian to Middle Triassic time, when Songpan Ganzi flysch deposition began. Permian conglomerate and basic volcanic rocks in the southeastern part of the allochthon indicate a second period of extension along the continental margin. Evidence suggests that the deep-water region along and west of the Yangtze continental margin was underlain mostly by thin continental crust, but its westernmost part may have contained areas underlain by oceanic crust. In the northern part of the Longmen Shan allochthon, thick Devonian to Upper Triassic shallow-water deposits of the Xue Shan platform are flanked by deep-marine rocks and the platform is interpreted to be a fragment of the Qinling continental margin transported westward during early Mesozoic transpressive tectonism. In the Longmen Shan region, the allochthon, carrying the western part of the Yangtze continental margin and Songpan Ganzi flysch, was emplaced to the southeast above rocks of the Yangtze platform autochthon. The eastern margin of the allochthon in the northern Longmen Shan is unconformably overlapped by both Lower and Middle Jurassic strata that are continuous with rocks of the autochthon. Folded rocks of the allochthon are unconformably overlapped by Lower and Middle Jurassic rocks in rare outcrops in the northern part of the region. They also are extensively intruded by a poorly dated, generally undeformed belt, of plutons whose ages (mostly K/Ar ages) range from Late Triassic to early Cenozoic, but most of the reliable ages are early Mesozoic. All evidence indicates that the major deformation within the allochthon is Late Triassic/Early Jurassic in age (Indosinian). The eastern front of the allochthon trends southwest across the present mountain front, so it lies along the mountain front in the northeast, but is located well to the west of the present mountain front on the south. The Late Triassic deformation is characterized by upright to overturned folded and refolded Triassic flysch, with generally NW-trending axial traces in the western part of the region. Folds and thrust faults curve to the north when traced to the east, so that along the eastern front of the allochthon structures trend northeast, involve pre-Triassic rocks, and parallel the eastern boundary of the allochthon. The curvature of structural trends is interpreted as forming part of a left-lateral transpressive boundary developed during emplacement of the allochthon. Regionally, the Longmen Shan lies along a NE-trending transpressive margin of the Yangtze platform within a broad zone of generally N-S shortening. North of the Longmen Shan region, northward subduction led to collision of the South and North China continental fragments along the Qinling Mountains, but northwest of the Longmen Shan region, subduction led to shortening within the Songpan Ganzi flysch basin, forming a detached fold-and-thrust belt. South of the Longmen Shan region, the flysch basin is bounded by the Shaluli Shan/Chola Shan arc?an originally Sfacing arc that reversed polarity in Late Triassic time, leading to shortening along the southern margin of the Songpan Ganzi flysch belt. Shortening within the flysch belt was oblique to the Yangtze continental margin such that the allochthon in the Longmen Shan region was emplaced within a left-lateral transpressive environment. Possible clockwise rotation of the Yangtze platform (part of the South China continental fragment) also may have contributed to left-lateral transpression with SE-directed shortening. During left-lateral transpression, the Xue Shan platform was displaced southwestward from the Qinling orogen and incorporated into the Longmen Shan allochthon. Westward movement of the platform caused complex refolding in the northern part of the Longmen Shan region. Emplacement of the allochthon flexurally loaded the western part of the Yangtze platform autochthon, forming a Late Triassic foredeep. Foredeep deposition, often involving thick conglomerate units derived from the west, continued from Middle Jurassic into Cretaceous time, although evidence for deformation of this age in the allochthon is generally lacking. Folding in the eastern Sichuan fold-and-thrust belt along the eastern side of the Sichuan Basin can be dated as Late Jurassic or Early Cretaceous in age, but only in areas 100 km east of the westernmost folds. Folding and thrusting was related to convergent activity far to the east along the eastern margin of South China. The westernmost folds trend southwest and merge to the south with folds and locally form refolded folds that involve Upper Cretaceous and lower Cenozoic rocks. The boundary between Cenozoic and late Mesozoic folding on the eastern and southern margins of the Sichuan Basin remains poorly determined. The present mountainous eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau in the Longmen Shan region is a consequence of Cenozoic deformation. It rises within 100 km from 500?600 m in the Sichuan Basin to peaks in the west reaching 5500 m and 7500 m in the north and south, respectively. West of these high peaks is the eastern part of the Tibetan Plateau, an area of low relief at an elevations of about 4000 m. Cenozoic deformation can be demonstrated in the autochthon of the southern Longmen Shan, where the stratigraphic sequence is without an angular unconformity from Paleozoic to Eocene or Oligocene time. During Cenozoic deformation, the western part of the Yangtze platform (part of the autochthon for Late Triassic deformation) was deformed into a N- to NE-trending foldandthrust belt. In its eastern part the fold-thrust belt is detached near the base of the platform succession and affects rocks within and along the western and southern margin of the Sichuan Basin, but to the west and south the detachment is within Proterozoic basement rocks. The westernmost structures of the fold-thrust belt form a belt of exposed basement massifs. During the middle and later part of the Cenozoic deformation, strike-slip faulting became important; the fold-thrust belt became partly right-lateral transpressive in the central and northeastern Longmen Shan. The southern part of the fold-thrust belt has a more complex evolution. Early Nto NE-trending folds and thrust faults are deformed by NW-trending basementinvolved folds and thrust faults that intersect with the NE-trending right-lateral strike-slip faults. Youngest structures in this southern area are dominated by left-lateral transpression related to movement on the Xianshuihe fault system. The extent of Cenozoic deformation within the area underlain by the early Mesozoic allochthon remains unknown, because of the absence of rocks of the appropriate age to date Cenozoic deformation. Klippen of the allochthon were emplaced above the Cenozoic fold-andthrust belt in the central part of the eastern Longmen Shan, indicating that the allochthon was at least partly reactivated during Cenozoic time. Only in the Min Shan in the northern part of the allochthon is Cenozoic deformation demonstrated along two active zones of E-W shortening and associated left-slip. These structures trend obliquely across early Mesozoic structures and are probably related to shortening transferred from a major zone of active left-slip faulting that trends through the western Qinling Mountains. Active deformation is along the left-slip transpressive NW-trending Xianshuihe fault zone in the south, right-slip transpression along several major NE-trending faults in the central and northeastern Longmen Shan, and E-W shortening with minor left-slip movement along the Min Jiang and Huya fault zones in the north. Our estimates of Cenozoic shortening along the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau appear to be inadequate to account for the thick crust and high elevation of the plateau.},

Experiments were performed in a wind tunnel with Reynolds numbers ranging from 0.85{\texttimes}10               5               to 3{\texttimes}10               5               . The spectra of the hot wire signals were obtained using a Fast Fourier Transform technique programmed on a PDP 11/40 computer. As regards a smooth cylinder, the main features of the vortex shedding mechanism in the subcritical regime remained unaltered for distances from the plane greater than approximately 0.4 diameters; in particular the Strouhal frequency did not show any significant variation relative to the typical value for an isolated cylinder. As for lower values of the distance from the plane, the regular vortex shedding disappeared and the hot wire spectra showed typical turbulent features. The possibility of obtaining supercritical conditions by roughening the cylinder surface was confirmed together with the importance of the Reynolds number based on the typical roughness size, R               k               , in the evaluation of the flow regime around the cylinder. In the case of roughened cylinders, and with values of R               k               below-350, the regular vortex shedding disappeared at a distance from the plane smaller than 0.3 diameters. This fact suggests that, at least in part of the supercritical regime, the influence of the plane can be smaller than in the subcritical regime.},

  abstract = {Dynamic topography formed over subducting oceanic lithosphere has been proposed as a mechanism to explain certain otherwise anomalous long-wavelength patterns of subsidence inferred from ancient strata. Forward modelling of mantle flow in response to a subducting slab predicts amplitudes and distributions of dynamic topography that may occur due to various subducting slab geometries and histories. Plotting calculated dynamic topographies at a point against time produces tectonic subsidence curves. These subsidence curves show features such as evolution from convex to concave shape, amplitudes up to 2000 m, subsidence rates up to 220 m Myr-1, and a general decrease in subsidence amplitude away from the subduction zone, over a distance of 2000 km. On many convergent continental margins, dynamic topography is likely to be superimposed on other subsidence mechanisms. In back-arc basins, subsidence due to dynamic topography should be distinguishable from that due to extensional tectonics based simply on the temporal subsidence evolution expressed in the subsidence curve shapes. In a foreland basin setting, comparing dynamic topography models with forward models of flexural loading suggest the two processes can generate similar temporal subsidence patterns, but that dynamic topography causes subsidence over significantly greater wavelengths. Matches between calculated subsidence due to dynamic topography and backstripped subsidence patterns from Upper Cretaceous strata of the Western Interior Basin, USA, support the hypothesis that a long-wavelength `background subsidence' was caused by dynamic topography.},

  abstract = {Both terrestrial and marine forces drive underground fluid flows in the coastal zone. Hydraulic gradients on land result in groundwater seepage near shore and may contribute to flows further out on the shelf from confined aquifers. Marine processes such as tidal pumping and current-induced pressure gradients may induce interfacial fluid flow anywhere on the shelf where permeable sediments are present. The terrestrial and oceanic forces overlap spatially so measured fluid advection through coastal sediments may be a result of composite forcing. We thus define "submarine groundwater discharge" (SGD) as any and all flow of water on continental margins from the seabed to the coastal ocean, regardless of fluid composition or driving force. SGD is typically characterized by low specific flow rates that make detection and quantification difficult. However, because such flows occur over very large areas, the total flux is significant. Discharging fluids, whether derived from land or composed of re-circulated seawater, will react with sediment components. These reactions may increase substantially the concentrations of nutrients, carbon, and metals in the fluids. These fluids are thus a source of biogeochemically important constituents to the coastal ocean. Terrestrially-derived fluids represent a pathway for new material fluxes to the coastal zone. This may result in diffuse pollution in areas where contaminated groundwaters occur. This paper presents an historical context of SGD studies, defines the process in a form that is consistent with our current understanding of the driving forces as well as our assessment techniques, and reviews the estimated global fluxes and biogeochemical implications. We conclude that to fully characterize marine geochemical budgets, one must give due consideration to SGD. New methodologies, technologies, and modeling approaches are required to discriminate among the various forces that drive SGD and to evaluate these fluxes more precisely.},

  abstract = {Heat-flow mapping of the western USA has identified an apparent low-heat-flow anomaly coincident with the Columbia Plateau Regional Aquifer System, a thick sequence of basalt aquifers within the Columbia River Basalt Group (CRBG). A heat and mass transport model (SUTRA) was used to evaluate the potential impact of groundwater flow on heat flow along two different regional groundwater flow paths. Limited in situ permeability (k) data from the CRBG are compatible with a steep permeability decrease (approximately 3.5 orders of magnitude) at 600-900 m depth and approximately 40{$^\circ$}C. Numerical simulations incorporating this permeability decrease demonstrate that regional groundwater flow can explain lower-than-expected heat flow in these highly anisotropic (kx/kz {$\sim$} 104) continental flood basalts. Simulation results indicate that the abrupt reduction in permeability at approximately 600 m depth results in an equivalently abrupt transition from a shallow region where heat flow is affected by groundwater flow to a deeper region of conduction-dominated heat flow. Most existing heat-flow measurements within the CRBG are from shallower than 600 m depth or near regional groundwater discharge zones, so that heat-flow maps generated using these data are likely influenced by groundwater flow. Substantial k decreases at similar temperatures have also been observed in the volcanic rocks of the adjacent Cascade Range volcanic arc and at Kilauea Volcano, Hawaii, where they result from low-temperature hydrothermal alteration. Regional groundwater flow can explain lower-than-expected heat flow in a thick sequence of highly anisotropic (kx/kz{$\sim$}104) continental flood basalts (Columbia River Basalt Group). A steep permeability decrease (approximately 3.5 orders of magnitude) is observed at 600-900 m depth and approximately 40{$^\circ$}C, possibly a result of low-temperature hydrothermal alteration.},

  abstract = {It is well accepted that the lithosphere may exhibit nonzero mechanical strength over geological time and space scales, associated with the existence of non-lithostatic (deviatoric) stress. The parameter that characterizes the apparent strength of the lithosphere is the flexural rigidity D, which is commonly expressed through the effective elastic thickness (Te) of the lithosphere. Estimates of Te for oceanic lithosphere approximately follow the depth to a specific isotherm ({$\sim$}600{$^\circ$}C), which marks the base of the mechanical lithosphere. The physical meaning and significance of the effective elastic thickness for continents are still enigmatic, because for continental lithosphere estimates of Te bear little relation to specific geological or physical boundaries. Although high observed values of Te (70--90 km for cratons) can be partly explained by the present-day temperature gradients, the low values (10--20 km), in general, cannot. In addition, the elastic plate models are self-inconsistent in that they mostly predict intraplate stresses high enough to lead to inelastic (brittle or ductile) deformation, according to data of rock mechanics. To provide a basis for a physically consistent unified interpretation of the observed variations of Te for continental and oceanic lithosphere, we developed an analytical and numerical approach that allows direct treatment of Te in terms of the lithospheric rheology, thermal structure, and strain/stress distribution. Our technique is based on finding true inelastic and equivalent (effective) elastic solutions for the problem of deformation of the lithosphere with realistic brittleelasto-ductile rheology. We show that the thermal state (thermotectonic age) of the lithosphere is only one of at least three equally important properties that determine apparent values of Te. These other properties are the state of the crust-mantle interface (decoupling of crust and mantle), the thickness and proportions of the mechanically competent crust and mantle, and the local curvature of the plate, which is directly related to the bending stresses. The thickness of the mechanically competent crust and the degree of coupling or decoupling is generally controlled by composition of the upper and lower crust, total thickness of the crust, and by the crustal geotherm. If decoupling takes place, it permits as much as 50\% decrease of Te, compared with Te implied from conventional thermal profiles. Comparison of the theoretically predicted Te with inferred values for different regions suggests that the lower crust of most continental plates has a low-temperature activation rheology (such as quartz) which permits crust and mantle decoupling. The curvature of the plate depends on the rheological structure and on the distribution of external loads applied to the plate (e.g., surface topography, sediment fill, and plate-boundary forces). Bending stresses created by major mountain belts are large enough to cause inelastic deformation (brittle failure and a ductile flow) in the underlying plate, which, in turn, leads to a 30 to 80\% decrease of Te beneath such belts and less beneath the adjacent regions. The boundary forces and moments (e.g., due to the slab pull, etc.) lead to more localized but even stronger reductions in Te (e.g., plate necking in subduction zones). Our approach provides a feedback between the ``observed'' Te and rheology, allowing to constrain the lithospheric structure from estimates of Te.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews various coal seam gas (CSG) models that have been developed for the Sydney Basin, and provides an alternative interpretation for gas composition layering and deep-seated CO2 origins. Open file CSG wells, supplemented by mine-scale information, were used to examine trends in gas content and composition at locations from the margin to the centre of the basin. Regionally available hydrochemistry data and interpretations of hydrodynamics were incorporated with conventional petroleum well data on porosity and permeability. The synthesised gas and groundwater model presented in this paper suggests that meteoric water flow under hydrostatic pressure transports methanogenic consortia into the subsurface and that water chemistry evolves during migration from calcium-rich freshwaters in inland recharge areas towards sodium-rich brackish water down-gradient and with depth. Groundwater chemistry changes result in the dissolution and precipitation of minerals as well as affecting the behaviour of dissolved gases such as CO2. Mixing of carbonate-rich waters with waters of significantly different chemistries at depth causes the liberation of CO2 gas from the solution that is adsorbed into the coal matrix in hydrodynamically closed terrains. In more open systems, excess CO2 in the groundwater (carried as bicarbonate) may lead to precipitation of calcite in the host strata. As a result, areas in the central and eastern parts of the basin do not host spatially extensive CO2 gas accumulations but experience more widespread calcite mineralisation, with gas compositions dominated by hydrocarbons, including wet gases. Basin boundary areas (commonly topographic and/or structural highs) in the northern, western and southern parts of the basin commonly contain CO2-rich gases at depth. This deep-seated CO2-rich gas is generally thought to derive from local to continental scale magmatic intrusions, but could also be the product of carbonate dissolution or acetate fermentation.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            A new method for modeling heat flux shows that the upper crust contributes up to 70\% of the Antarctic Peninsula's subglacial heat flux and that heat flux values are more variable at smaller spatial resolutions than geophysical methods can resolve. Results indicate a higher heat flux on the east and south of the Peninsula (mean 81~mW~m               -2               ) where silicic rocks predominate, than on the west and north (mean 67~mW~m               -2               ) where volcanic arc and quartzose sediments are dominant. While the data supports the contribution of heat-producing element-enriched granitic rocks to high heat flux values, sedimentary rocks can be of comparative importance dependent on their provenance and petrography. Models of subglacial heat flux must utilize a heterogeneous upper crust with variable radioactive heat production if they are to accurately predict basal conditions of the ice sheet. Our new methodology and data set facilitate improved numerical model simulations of ice sheet dynamics.                        ,              Plain Language Summary             As the climate changes, the Antarctic ice sheet represents the single largest potential source of sea level rise. However, one key parameter controlling how the ice sheet flows remains poorly constrained: the effect of heat derived from the Earth's geology on the base of the ice sheet (known as subglacial heat flux). Although this may not seem like a lot of heat, under slow-flowing ice, this ``heat flux'' can control how well the ice sheet can flow over the rocks and even lead to melting of the ice at its base. Current models for Antarctica's heat flux use geophysics to determine how thin the crust is and consequently how easily heat from the Earth's mantle can warm the surface. We show here that heat produced by radioactive decay within the Earth's crust can have an even greater and much more variable contribution to the subglacial heat flux than estimated by these previous models. We present a new methodology allowing this crustal heat production to be calculated and combined with the geophysical models, producing a new map of heat flux on the Antarctic Peninsula highlighting the variations in heat flux caused by different rock types.           ,              Key Points                                                                As a direct result of lithological heterogeneities in the upper crust, subglacial heat flux is much more variable than can be resolved by geophysical methods                                                     Upper crustal heat production on the Antarctic Peninsula contributes 6--70\% of the total subglacial heat flux                                                     Sedimentary basins can produce comparably high heat fluxes to granitic intrusions; coupled with their erodible nature, these basins may impart a greater control on ice sheet dynamics than previously recognized},

These motions may be the result of mantle convection and, if so, constitute a style of interior--surface coupling not seen elsewhere in the inner Solar System except for continental interiors on Earth. Venus' fragmented, mobile lithosphere may offer a framework for understanding how tectonics on Earth operated in the Archean.           ,              Venus has been thought to possess a globally continuous lithosphere, in contrast to the mosaic of mobile tectonic plates that characterizes Earth. However, the Venus surface has been extensively deformed, and convection of the underlying mantle, possibly acting in concert with a low-strength lower crust, has been suggested as a source of some surface horizontal strains. The extent of surface mobility on Venus driven by mantle convection, however, and the style and scale of its tectonic expression have been unclear. We report a globally distributed set of crustal blocks in the Venus lowlands that show evidence for having rotated and/or moved laterally relative to one another, akin to jostling pack ice. At least some of this deformation on Venus postdates the emplacement of the locally youngest plains materials. Lithospheric stresses calculated from interior viscous flow models consistent with long-wavelength gravity and topography are sufficient to drive brittle failure in the upper Venus crust in all areas where these blocks are present, confirming that interior convective motion can provide a mechanism for driving deformation at the surface. The limited but widespread lithospheric mobility of Venus, in marked contrast to the tectonic styles indicative of a static lithosphere on Mercury, the Moon, and Mars, may offer parallels to interior--surface coupling on the early Earth, when global heat flux was substantially higher, and the lithosphere generally thinner, than today.},

The numerous attempts to account for this case in either Kuhnian or Lakatosian terms have been convincingly dismissed by Rachel Laudan (PSA: Proceedings of the Biennial Meeting of the Philosophy of Science Association. Symposia and Invited Papers, 1978), who nevertheless acknowledged that there was not yet a plausible alternative to explain the so called ``geological revolution''. Several decades later, the epistemological side of this revolution has received much attention (Ruse in The darwinian paradigm, essays on its history, philosophy and religious implications. London, Routledge, 1981/1989; Thagard in Conceptual revolutions. Princeton University Press, Princeton, 1992; Marvin in Metascience 10:208--217, 2001; Oreskes in Plate tectonics: an insiders' history of the modern theory of the earth. Westview Press, Boulder, 2003), while the semantic relation between drift theory and plate tectonics has remained mainly unexplored. In studying this case under a new light, the notion of embedding, as distinguished from other sorts of intertheoretical relations (Moulines in Cognitio Humana---Dynamik des Wissens und der Werte. XVII, Institut fu{\textasciidieresis}r Philosophie der Universita{\textasciidieresis}t Leipzig, Leipzig, 1996, Time, chance, and reduction: philosophical aspects of statistical mechanics. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2010, Metatheoria 1(2):11--27, 2011), will have a particular significance. After formally analyzing the relationship between continental drift and plate tectonics, it will become evident that the models of drift theory are part of the models of plate tectonics, thereby fulfilling the conditions for embedding. All theoretical concepts from drift theory are presupposed in some theoretical concepts from plate tectonics, and all empirical concepts of the former are shared by the latter. Furthermore, all the successful paradigmatic applications of continental drift are also successful applications of plate tectonics. As a consequence, under the label ``geological revolution'', we actually find a salient historical case of cumulative progress across theory change.},

However, the residence time of these subducted materials in the mantle is uncertain and model-dependent, and compelling evidence for their return to the surface in regions of mantle upwelling beneath hotspots is lacking. Here we report anomalous sulphur isotope signatures indicating mass-independent fractionation (MIF) in olivine-hosted sulphides from 20-million-year-old ocean island basalts from Mangaia, Cook Islands (Polynesia), which have been suggested to sample recycled oceanic crust. Terrestrial MIF sulphur isotope signatures (in which the amount of fractionation does not scale in proportion with the difference in the masses of the isotopes) were generated exclusively through atmospheric photochemical reactions until about 2.45 billion years ago. Therefore, the discovery of MIF sulphur in these young plume lavas suggests that sulphur-probably derived from hydrothermally altered oceanic crust-was subducted into the mantle before 2.45 billion years ago and recycled into the mantle source of Mangaia lavas. These new data provide evidence for ancient materials, with negative {$\Delta$} 33 S values, in the mantle source for Mangaia lavas. Our data also complement evidence for recycling of the sulphur content of ancient sedimentary materials to the subcontinental lithospheric mantle that has been identified in diamond-hosted sulphide inclusions. This Archaean age for recycled oceanic crust also provides key constraints on the length of time that subducted crustal material can survive in the mantle, and on the timescales of mantle convection from subduction to upwelling beneath hotspots. {\copyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Shear anelasticity introduces a significant non-linear dependence of seismic velocities on temperature in the upper-mantle. This means that seismic anomalies with similar amplitudes but different signs correspond to temperature anomalies of a different magnitude, and absolute seismic velocities are required for making a thermal interpretation. With depth, the importance of anelasticity decreases. Temperature derivatives of bulk sound velocity (V{$\phi$}) and density ({$\rho$}) are a factor two to five lower than those of VP,S and do not depend strongly on temperature. Common mantle compositions cause velocity anomalies of about 1\% throughout the upper-mantle. Above 400km depth, the effect of composition on VP and VS is secondary to the effect of temperature, but it gains importance with increasing depth. For most upper-mantle compositions and depths, the relative sensitivity of VP, VS and V{$\phi$} to temperature and composition is not different enough to distinguish the two factors from combined velocity models. But {$\partial$}ln{$\rho$}/{$\partial$}lnVS allows a separation of thermal anomalies from compositional anomalies for iron-depleted and subducted material. Spherically symmetric reference profiles underlie most seismic velocity models. However, small differences between common one-dimensional velocity models translate into disparate thermal interpretations. A better understanding of seismic uncertainties and the physical interpretation of reference models is necessary to interpret absolute velocities. Assuming seismic structure is well resolved and composition known, uncertainties in inferred thermal structure are {\textpm}100{$^\circ$}C above 400km depth and {\textpm}250{$^\circ$}C in the shallow lower-mantle. This makes an inversion of seismic velocity models for temperature feasible, above 400km depth. At larger depths, testing seismic velocities calculated for a proposed thermal and compositional structure against observations is a more promising interpretation approach.},

  abstract = {Imposing a thermal and compositional significance to the outcome of the inversion of seismic data facilitates their interpretation. Using long-period seismic waveforms and an inversion approach that includes constraints from mineral physics, we find that lateral variations of temperature can explain a large part of the data in the upper mantle. The additional compositional signature of cratons emerges in the global model as well. Above 300 km, we obtain seismic geotherms that span the range of expected temperatures in various tectonic regions. Absolute velocities and gradients with depth are well constrained by the seismic data throughout the upper mantle, except near discontinuities. The seismic data are consistent with a slower transition zone and an overall faster shallow upper mantle, which is not compatible with a homogenous dry pyrolite composition. A gradual enrichment with depth in a garnet-rich component helps to reduce the observed discrepancies. A hydrated transition zone would help to lower the velocities in the transition zone, but it does not explain the seismic structure above it.},

But the timing and magnitude of the plate motions leading to the development of this rift system remain poorly known, because of a lack of magnetic anomaly and fracture zone constraints on seafloor spreading. Here we report on magnetic data, gravity data and swath bathymetry collected in several areas of the south Tasman Sea and northern Ross Sea. These results enable us to calculate mid-Cenozoic rotation parameters for East and West Antarctica. These rotations show that there was roughly 180 km of separation in the western Ross Sea embayment in Eocene and Oligocene time. This episode of extension provides a tectonic setting for several significant Cenozoic tectonic events in the Ross Sea embayment including the uplift of the Transantarctic Mountains and the deposition of large thicknesses of Oligocene sediments. Inclusion of this East-West Antarctic motion in the plate circuit linking the Australia, Antarctic and Pacific plates removes a puzzling gap between the Lord Howe rise and Campbell plateau found in previous early Tertiary reconstructions of the New Zealand region. Determination of this East-West Antarctic motion also resolves a long standing controversy regarding the contribution of deformation in this region to the global plate circuit linking the Pacific to the rest of the world.},

  abstract = {The processes that operated on the early Earth and the tectonic regimes in which it was shaped are poorly constrained, reflecting the highly fragmentary rock record and uncertainty in geodynamic conditions. Most models of early Earth geodynamics invoke a poorly mobile lid regime, involving little or episodic movement of the lithosphere, above a convecting mantle. However, such a regime does not reconcile with the record of Archean tectonics, which displays contrasting environments associated with either non-plate tectonics or plate tectonics. Here, we propose a regime for the early Earth in which progressive melt extraction at sites of divergence led to the formation of large portions of stiffer lithospheric lid, called proto-plates. These proto-plates enabled stress propagation to be focussed at their margins, which were then the locus for extension as oppose to shortening, under-thrusting and thickening to form adjoining proto-cratons. We test this hypothesis embedding lithospheric stiffening during melt extraction in thermo-mechanical models of mantle convection, under conditions that prevailed in the Archean. We demonstrate the emergence of migrating, rigid proto-plates in which regions of prolonged focused compression coexist with remnants of the stagnant lid, thereby reproducing the widespread dichotomy proposed for the Archean tectonic record. These diverse tectonic modes coexist in a single regime that is viable since the Hadean and lasted until the transition to modern plate tectonics.},

The rate of magma supply, mechanical properties of the crust and magma, and tectonic regime are known to play a role in controlling eruption frequency and magnitude, but their relative contributions have not been quantified. Here we use a thermomechanical numerical model of magma injection into Earth's crust and Monte Carlo simulations to explore the factors controlling the recurrence rates of eruptions of different magnitudes. We find that the rate of magma supply to the upper crust controls the volume of a single eruption. The time interval between magma injections into the subvolcanic reservoir, at a constant magma-supply rate, determines the duration of the magmatic activity that precedes eruptions. Our simulations reproduce the observed relationship between eruption volume and magma chamber residence times and replicate the observed correlation between erupted volumes and caldera dimensions. We also find that magma buoyancy is key to triggering super-eruptions, whereas pressurization associated with magma injection is responsible for relatively small and frequent eruptions. Our findings help improve our ability to decipher the long-term activity patterns of volcanic systems.},

  abstract = {Deformation of volcanic edifices is typically attributed to the movement of magma within the volcanic plumbing system, but a wide range of magmatic processes are capable of producing significant volume variations and may also produce deformation. In order to understand the evolution of magmatic systems prior to eruption and correctly interpret monitoring signals, it is necessary to quantify the patterns and timescales of surface deformation that processes such as crystallisation, degassing and expansion of the hydrothermal system can produce. We show how the combination of petrology and thermal modelling can be applied to geodetic observations to identify the processes occurring in a magmatic reservoir during volcanic unrest. Thermal modelling and petrology were used to determine the timescales and volumetric variations associated with cooling, crystallisation and gas exsolution. These calculations can be performed rapidly and highlight the most likely processes responsible for the variation of a set of monitoring parameters. We then consider the magnitude and timescales of deformation produced by other processes occurring within the vicinity of an active magma system. We apply these models to a time series of geodetic data spanning the period between the 1997 and 2008 eruptions of Okmok volcano, Aleutians, examining scenarios involving crystallisation, degassing and remelting of the crystallising shallow magmatic body and including a viscoelastic shell or hydrothermal system. The geodetic observations are consistent with the injection of a water-saturated basalt, followed by minor crystallisation and degassing. Other scenarios are not compatible either with the magnitude or rate of the deformation signals. {\copyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Petrology, thermal modeling, and magma rheology are combined to investigate the evolution of strain recorded by enclaves during the piecemeal assembly of a pluton growing at various rates of magma input. The different compositions (and hence phase relations) of host magma and enclaves limits homogeneous deformation of these two materials to restricted temperature ranges, which we term \&\#8220;windows of mutual deformability.\&\#8221; Outside these windows only the less viscous host granite records any appreciable deformation and enclaves are mainly transported as rigid objects. The temporal and spatial development of the windows of mutual deformability reflects the emplacement rate of magmas into the pluton. Consequently, the radial distribution of strain recorded by enclaves can provide a picture of the thermal and rheological evolution of a magmatic body during its construction. Our approach is applied to deformation patterns of mafic enclaves in the Lago della Vacca Complex (LVC) of the Adamello Massif (Italy), to estimate the timescales of pluton emplacement. Our calculations suggest total emplacement timescales of the order 50 to 150 ky, in excellent agreement with recent high precision radiometric dating of zircons from the LVC.},

All samples are carbon-saturated. One, the so-called popping rock 2{$\Pi$}D43 kept its vesicles, the initial (pre-degassing) C-contents of the 16 other samples being reconstructed from their assumed degassing history. For water, the samples show large variations, from 1300 to 6900 ppm and from 1900 to 7900 ppm with associated {$\delta$}D-values ranging from - 55 to - 79‚Ä∞ and from - 55 to - 88‚Ä∞ for samples at 14{$^\circ$} N and 34{$^\circ$} N respectively. For carbon, the inferred initial predegassing contents vary greatly, from 660 to 14,700 ppmCO2 and from 1400 to 57,600 ppmCO2 for samples at 14{$^\circ$} N and 34{$^\circ$} N respectively. Measured Nb-contents range from 4.5 to 29.6 ppm show both good agreement with previously published data and positive correlations with reconstructed initial CO2-contents. The mean CO2/Nb range from {$\sim$} 570 to {$\sim$} 730 at 14{$^\circ$} N and 34{$^\circ$} N respectively. CO2 and Nb data for the two undegassed samples available so far (i.e. the popping rock of the present study and the basaltic glasses from the Siqueiros transform fault from the study of Saal et al., 2002) show significant variations in CO2/Nb over a factor of 2 and thus questions the constant CO2/Nb previously emphasised for these two samples, this view being supported by CO2/Nb-ratios of samples whose initial C-contents were reconstructed. For incompatible elements such as Ce, K and including water, a comparison of the geochemical characteristics of transform fault basaltic magmatism with other MORB systems shows magma transform fault magmatism to be unrepresentative of mantle compositions. Assuming a more appropriate average MORB CO2/Nb-ratio of {$\sim$} 530 and a mean MORB Nb-content of 3.31- 1.8+ 3.99, we computed a mantle carbon flux of 2.3- 1.3+ 2.7 {\texttimes} 1012 mol/yr, a value actually consistent with that derived from C/3He systematics. {\copyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {A geostatistical approach is presented for the inclusion of seismic tomography data and sonic log data into the estimation of hydraulic conductivity. The procedure accounts for the errors in seismic tomography inversion and for the correlation of such errors. The proposed methodology consists of two steps: (1) the cross-variogram inference is carried out using only the data at the wellbore (both hydraulic and seismic); (2) a co-kriging procedure takes the cross-well data into account to interpolate between boreholes. No postulated a- priori relationship is needed. In order to illustrate the methodology a synthetic data set is generated on the basis of evidence from published case studies and simplified physical considerations. The numerical experiments show that the choice of the excitation frequency is critical. A trade-off exists between the need for a high-resolution survey (asking for higher frequencies) and the need for a good correlation between hydraulic conductivity and seismic properties (asking for frequencies below the squirt frequency of the medium). In the simulation using seismic data with the best excitation frequency (1 kHz in this case), the mean squared error of the hydraulic conductivity estimate is two-thirds lower than using hydraulic data alone. It is important to note also that only a part of the interwell region is adequately sampled by the tomographic experiment. Such a region can be readily identified by calculating the energy of the quasi-null space, through singular value decomposition of the tomographic matrix. In planning this type of experiments, it is necessary to carefully verify case by case whether the adopted range of high frequencies does not prevent the seismic energy from propagating effectively from sources to receivers.},

  abstract = {One of the most remarkable features of many and, perhaps, all oceanic basalts is that their Pb isotopic ratios (206Pb/204Pb, 207Pb/204Pb and 208Pb/204Pb) are too radiogenic to be coming from the undifferentiated mantle or bulk silicate Earth. This has created three major concerns in the behavior of U, Th and Pb in the Earth's mantle that have been termed the Pb paradoxes. These are the unexpectedly long time-integrated high U/Pb (1st paradox), long time-integrated low Th/U (2nd paradox) and constant Ce/Pb and Nb/U (3rd paradox) in the mantle sources of oceanic basalts. The origins of such unexpected ratios have been the object of intense studies that produced several highly significant, but generally individualized results during the last four decades. Detailed analysis of available data shows that the paradoxes are closely interrelated as they all pertain to the mantle and have many common characteristic features. Thus, the Pb paradoxes constitute a system of equations that must be solved all together as each solution must satisfy every equation in the system. For example, compositional data for the voluminous mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORB) show that the 1st and 2nd paradoxes exhibit a long time-integrated enrichment of U and the Th/U and Nb/Th ratios are also constant. A single solution to simultaneously explain the paradoxes in MORB is possible if recycled materials with variable enrichments in incompatible trace elements, particularly U and its daughter Pb* plus Nb, Ce, and Th are added to or mixed with the depleted upper mantle. Significantly, a similar binary mixing solution has been proposed for the Pb paradoxes in ocean island basalts.}

  abstract = {Plate tectonics, involving a globally linked system of lateral motion of rigid surface plates, is a characteristic feature of our planet, but estimates of how long it has been the modus operandi of lithospheric formation and interactions range from the Hadean to the Neoproterozoic. In this paper, we review sedimentary, igneous and metamorphic proxies along with palaeomagnetic data to infer both the development of rigid lithospheric plates and their independent relative motion, and conclude that significant changes in Earth behaviour occurred in the mid- to late Archaean, between 3.2\,Ga and 2.5\,Ga. These data include: sedimentary rock associations inferred to have accumulated in passive continental margin settings, marking the onset of sea-floor spreading; the oldest foreland basin deposits associated with lithospheric convergence; a change from thin, new continental crust of mafic composition to thicker crust of intermediate composition, increased crustal reworking and the emplacement of potassic and peraluminous granites, indicating stabilization of the lithosphere; replacement of dome and keel structures in granite-greenstone terranes, which relate to vertical tectonics, by linear thrust imbricated belts; the commencement of temporally paired systems of intermediate and high dT/dP gradients, with the former interpreted to represent subduction to collisional settings and the latter representing possible hinterland back-arc settings or ocean plateau environments. Palaeomagnetic data from the Kaapvaal and Pilbara cratons for the interval 2780--2710\,Ma and from the Superior, Kaapvaal and Kola-Karelia cratons for 2700--2440\,Ma suggest significant relative movements. We consider these changes in the behaviour and character of the lithosphere to be consistent with a gestational transition from a non-plate tectonic mode, arguably with localized subduction, to the onset of sustained plate tectonics.

  abstract = {Reconstructions of the Cambrian--Silurian tectonic evolution of eastern Gondwanaland, when the Australian Tasmanides and Antarctic Ross Orogen developed, rely on correlation between structural elements in SE Australia and Northern Victoria Land (NVL), Antarctica. A variety of published models exist but none completely solve the tectonic puzzle that is the Delamerian--Lachlan transition in the Tasmanides. This paper summarizes the understanding of Cambrian (Delamerian) to Silurian (Lachlan) geological evolution of the eastern Tasmanides, taking into account new deep seismic data that clarifies the geological connection between Victoria and Tasmania --- the `Selwyn Block' model. It evaluates previous attempts at correlation between NVL, Tasmania and Victoria, and presents a new scenario that encompasses the most robust correlations. Tasmania together with the Selwyn Block is reinterpreted as an exotic Proterozoic microcontinental block -- `VanDieland' -- that collided into the east Gondwanaland margin south of western Victoria, and north of NVL in the Late Cambrian, perhaps terminating the Delamerian Orogeny in SE Australia. Subsequent north-east `tectonic escape' of VanDieland in the Early Ordovician explains the present-day outboard position of Tasmania with respect to the rest of the Delamerian orogen, the origin of the hiatus that separates the Delamerian and Lachlan orogenic cycles in Australia, and how western Lachlan oceanic crust developed as a `trapped plate-segment'. The model establishes a new structural template for subsequent Lachlan Orogen development and Mesozoic Australia--Antarctica separation.},

This correlation is supported by a pre-Early Ordovician unconformity above gabbro protomylonite at Waratah Bay, age equivalent to the Tasmanian Tyennan unconformity. Cambrian volcanics at Licola and unusual features of the Melbourne Zone sequence indicate that Tyennan continental crust extends north as basement to the central Victorian portion of the Lachlan Fold Belt. In contrast, adjacent parts of the Lachlan Fold Belt in Victoria contain conformable sea-floor sequences that span the Early Cambrian to Late Ordovician, with no evidence of either Cambrian deformation or underlying continental basement. The block of Tyennan continental crust beneath central Victoria---the Selwyn Block---is fundamentally different, and has influenced temporal and spatial patterns of sedimentation, deformation, metamorphism and plutonism. Palaeogeographical reconstructions suggest that the block was a submarine plateau that lay outboard of the Australian craton, upon which a condensed Ordovician sequence was deposited. The sequence above the Selwyn Block unconformity at Waratah Bay is similar to widespread post-Tyennan sediments in western Tasmania. During Late Ordovician and Early Silurian deformation, the Selwyn Block protected much of the overlying sedimentary sequence. Instead, shortening was focused into the Stawell and Bendigo Zones to the west. These zones were sandwiched between the Selwyn Block and the Australian craton in a `vice' scenario reminiscent of some Appalachian orogenic events. The region above the Selwyn Block was downwarped adjacent to the overthrust Bendigo Zone as a foreland deep, into which a conformable clastic wedge of sediment was deposited in Late Ordovician to Devonian time, prior to final Middle Devonian deformation. The Selwyn Block includes the Cambrian calc-alkaline Licola and Jamieson Volcanics that are correlated with the Tasmanian Mt Read Volcanics. In Victoria, these form a basement high controlling the unusual down-cutting thrusts in the overlying Melbourne Zone and explaining the major structural vergence reversal between the Melbourne and Tabberabbera Zones. The Selwyn Block has exerted some control on the timing, chemistry and distribution of post-orogenic granites, and on central Victorian gold mineralisation. Reactivated faults in the block influenced deposition, and continue to control the deformation of the portions of the Otway and Gippsland Basins that lie above it. KEY}

Numerical solution based on the standard               h               -based form of Richards equation generally yields poor results, characterized by large mass balance errors and erroneous estimates of infiltration depth. Conversely, numerical solutions based on the mixed form of Richards equation can be shown to possess the conservative property, so that mass is perfectly conserved. This leads to significant improvement in numerical solution performance, while requiring no additional computational effort. However, use of the mass-conservative method does not guarantee good solutions. Accurate solution of the unsaturated flow equation also requires use of a diagonal time (or mass) matrix. Only when diagonal time matrices are used can the solution be shown to obey a maximum principle, which guarantees smooth, nonoscillatory infiltration profiles. This highlights the fact that proper treatment of the time derivative is critical in the numerical solution of unsaturated flow.},

As a rule, temperature profiles to depths of 200--300 m record surface temperature trends accurately over the last two centuries or so; deeper holes may reveal climate history farther back but with decreasing resolution.We present several synthetic temperature-depth profiles to demonstrate the expected signature of past surface temperature changes in the subsurface, the analysis of which may help better identify the climate of the past. Examples of extracted climate recollections from holes in North America and Europe are discussed. While inconspicuous underground records may correspond to the postglacial warming 8--11 kyr ago, reasonably well-documented borehole logging data have confirmed climate excursions in the past millenium, namely the Little Climate Optimum and the Little Ice Age. Traces of recent warming are generally common in many temperature records, evidencing the temperature rise by 1--2 K over the past 100 years.},

  abstract = {Onshore and offshore deep seismic reflection data have been integrated to produce two-way travel-time and depth maps of the seismic reflection Moho beneath the UK. Moho travel-times are mostly in the range 9.5-11.5 s, showing only weak correlation with specific upper crustal structural features, but decreasing generally northwestward towards the Atlantic margin. Moho depths show a much stronger correlation with upper crustal structure than do travel-times. There is pronounced crustal thinning (Moho depths {\textbackslash}textless25 km) beneath the central and northern North Sea grabens and the basins of the northwest margin. Less marked crustal thinning is evident beneath the basins of the Irish Sea, English Channel and southern North Sea. Greatest Moho depths ({\textbackslash}textgreater32 km) are found generally beneath basement massifs, particularly onshore. Short-wavelength topographic features on the Moho are quite rare, and are generally restricted to ancient zones of continental collision and/or subduction. Some of these ancient collision and/or subduction zones are spatially associated with a highly reflective Moho. This is particularly evident where low-angle shear-zones, in the lower crust or uppermost mantle, converge with or intersect the Moho. It is suggested that development of a Moho detachment surface can tectonically smooth the Moho and thereby markedly increase its reflectivity. A tendency in certain areas for the Moho to remain at roughly constant two-way travel-time (though not constant depth) beneath both sedimentary basins and intervening basement massifs is interpreted as indicating that structural features on the scale of several tens of kilometres are in regional isostatic equilibrium. Conversely, travel-time perturbations beneath smaller features ({$\sim$}10 km across), indicate that these are at least partially uncompensated. The UK crust is therefore weak, but not sufficiently weak to attain local Airy isostasy. Basement massifs west of Scotland show systematically smaller Moho two-way travel-times than similar structures farther south. Within the constraints of regional isostasy, this can be interpreted in two main ways. Greater rigidity and strength of Lewisian rocks within the west Scottish massifs (manifest as higher seismic velocity relative to density) could be a cause of the observed travel-time differences. Alternatively, low-density material beneath the crust could buoy up the western Scottish massifs. If this buoyancy were the consequence of igneous underplating, then any underplated material would have to lie beneath the seismic reflection Moho.},

The salient feature of this inversion is that the initial depth of the basement is not a required input. The proposed inversion simultaneously estimates the depth of the basement interface and the regional gravity background. Applicability and efficacy of the inversion is demonstrated with a synthetic model of a density interface. We analyze the synthetic gravity anomalies (1) solely because of the structure, (2) in the presence of a regional gravity background, and (3) in the presence of both random noise and regional gravity background. The inverted structure remains more or less the same, regardless of whether the regional background is simulated with a second-degree polynomial or a bilinear equation. The depth of the structure and estimated regional background deviate only modestly from the assumed ones in the presence of random noise and regional background. The analyses of two sets of real field data, one over the Chintalpudi subbasin, India, and another over the Pannonian basin, eastern Austria, yield geologically plausible models with the estimated depths that compare well with drilling data. {\copyright} 2007 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.},

  abstract = {Bayesian inference provides a principled approach towards uncertainty quantification of free parameters in geophysical forward models. This provides advantages over optimization methods that provide single point estimates as solutions, which lack uncertainty quantification. Badlands (basin and landscape dynamics model) is geophysical forward model that simulates topography development at various space and time scales. Badlands consists of a number of geophysical parameters that need to be estimated with appropriate uncertainty quantification, given the observed ground truth such as surface topography, sediment thickness and stratigraphy through time. This is challenging due to the scarcity of data, sensitivity of the parameters and complexity of the Badlands model. In this paper, we take a Bayesian approach to provide inference using Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling (MCMC). Hence, we present \${\textbackslash}backslash\$textit\{BayesLands\}, a Bayesian framework for Badlands that fuses information obtained from complex forward models with observational data and prior knowledge. As a proof-of-concept, we consider a synthetic and real-world topography with two free parameters, namely precipitation and erodibility, that we need to estimate through BayesLands. The results of the experiments shows that BayesLands yields a promising distribution of the parameters. Moreover, the challenge in sampling due to multi-modality is presented through visualizing a likelihood surface that has a range of suboptimal modes.},

The common parameter, aquifer thickness (t), has been used to combine the two relations and form an analytical equation. Mathematical relation shows a negative correlation between hydraulic conductivity and aquifer resistivity, and a positive correlation between transmissivity and longitudinal conductance. The methodology has been calibrated and validated in hard rock granite aquifers in India. The good agreement between aquifer hydraulic conductivity (K) and transmissivity (T) obtained from the resistivity sounding parameters and those obtained from pumping test analysis proves the potentiality of the methodology.

We incorporate crustal thickness perturbations as model parameters in the inversions to properly consider crustal effects and suppress the leakage of crustal structure into mantle structure. This is possible since we utilize short-period group-velocity data with a period range down to 16s, which are strongly sensitive to the crust. The isotropic S velocity model shares common features with previous global S velocity models and shows excellent consistency with several high-resolution upper mantle models. Our anisotropic model also agrees well with previous regional studies. Anomalous features in our anisotropic model are faster SV velocity anomalies along subduction zones at transition zone depths and faster SH velocity beneath slabs in the lower mantle. The derived crustal thickness perturbations also bring potentially important information about the crustal thickness beneath oceanic crusts, which has been difficult to constrain due to poor access compared with continental crusts.},

  abstract = {In a three-dimensional (3D) gravity inversion, there is a need to restrain the number of solution by adding constraints. We present an inversion method based on the stochastic approach. It attempts to minimize an objective function consisting of the sum of the data misfit squared norm weighted by the data error covariances and the model squared norm weighted by the parameter covariances. The minimization of the latter allows reconstruction of structures of different shapes. The algorithm also includes depth weighting and may use borehole data. The effect of the selected parameter covariance matrix is illustrated in a comparison of two inversions for a dipping short dyke. These covariances can be determined either a priori using available geological data or experimentally by fitting density variograms. Depth weighting prevents the inversion from yielding undesirable shallow density structures when using ground survey data only; however, it cannot provide a good delineation of the bodies. Using borehole data in addition to surface data improves the determination of the geometry and position of the bodies. For the latter, the depth weighting is replaced by weights that are dependent on the norm of the kernel terms. Density estimates, from outcrops samples or well logging data, can be set fixed where known within the model. Density positivity constraint can also be included when needed. Gravity data from the Blake River Group in the Rouyn-Noranda mining camp (Quebec, Canada) is used to show the performance of the method, with the inclusion of borehole and surface density data. {\copyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Most, but not all authors believe that recycled crust is incorporated into the plume source of oceanic basalts. The hafnium (Hf) and neodymium (Nd) isotopic compositions of basalts from oceanic islands and mid-ocean ridges exhibit a linear relationship the mantle array which is thought to result from mixing between material from the depleted mantle and an enriched recycled component. Here, we model the Hf-Nd isotopic composition of oceanic basalts as a mixture of recycled oceanic crust and depleted mantle and find that recycling of basalt alone is not sufficient to reproduce the mantle array. We conclude that oceanic sediments, which have a relatively high 176Hf/177Hf ratio, must also be recycled. Combining oceanic sediments with recycled oceanic basalts and subsequent mixing with depleted mantle peridotite produces Hf and Nd isotopic compositions that coincide with the mantle array. The composition of bulk continental crust requires the existence of a complementary low 176Hf/177Hf reservoir, which we suggest is zircon-rich sediment. ? 2008 Nature Publishing Group.}

Here we use three-dimensional numerical models to evaluate the effects of crustal rheology on the formation of the Himalayan-Tibetan orogenic system. During convergence, a weaker Asian crust allows strain far north within the upper plate, where a wide continental plateau forms behind the orogeny. In contrast, a stronger Asian crust suppresses the plateau formation, while the orogeny accommodates most of the shortening. The stronger Asian lithosphere is also forced beneath the Indian lithosphere, forming a reversed-polarity underthrusting. Our results demonstrate that the observed variations in lithosphere deformation and structures along the India-Asia collision zone are primarily controlled by the strength heterogeneity of the Asian continental crust.},

The proposed algorithm considers the effects of diffraction, scattering and traveltime alteration caused by 3-D volumetric heterogeneities. It is therefore particularly useful for imaging complex 3-D structures such as dipping discontinuities, which is hard to accomplish with traditional methods. The scheme is based on the acoustic wave migration principle, where at each time step of the receiver function, the energy is migrated back to the ensemble of potential conversion points in the image, given a smooth 3-D reference model. Traveltimes for P and S waves are computed with an efficient eikonal solver, the fast marching method. We also consider elastic scattering patterns, where the amplitude of converted S waves depends on the angle between the incident P wave and the scattered S wave. Synthetic experiments demonstrate the validity of the method for a variety of dipping angle discontinuities. Comparison with the widely used common conversion point (CCP) stacking method reveals that our migration shows considerable improvement. For example, the effect of multiple reflections that usually produce apparent discontinuities is avoided. The proposed approach is practical, computationally efficient, and is therefore a potentially powerful alternative to standard CCP methods for imaging large-scale continental structure under dense networks.},

  abstract = {In nature, subducting slabs and overriding plate segments bordering subduction zones are generally embedded within larger plates. Such large plates can impose far-field boundary conditions that influence the style of subduction and overriding plate deformation. Here we present dynamic laboratory models of progressive subduction in three-dimensional space, in which the far-field boundary conditions at the trailing edges of the subducting plate (SP) and overriding plate (OP) are varied. Four configurations are presented: Free (both plates free), SP-Fixed, OP-Fixed, and SP-OP-Fixed. We investigate their impact on the kinematics and dynamics of subduction, particularly focusing on overriding plate deformation. The results indicate that the variation in far-field boundary conditions has an influence on the slab geometry, subduction partitioning, and trench migration partitioning. Our models also indicate that in natural (narrow) subduction zones, assuming a homogeneous overriding plate, the formation of back-arc basins (e.g., Tyrrhenian Sea, Aegean Sea, and Scotia Sea) is generally expected to occur at a comparable location (250--700 km from the trench), irrespective of the boundary condition. In addition, our models indicate that the style of fore-arc deformation (shortening or extension) is influenced by the mobility of the overriding plate through controlling the force normal to the subduction zone interface (trench suction). Our geodynamic model that uses the SP-OP-Fixed setup is comparable to the Calabria subduction zone with respect to subduction kinematics, slab geometry, trench curvature, and accretionary configuration. Furthermore, the model can explain back-arc and fore-arc extension at the Calabria subduction zone since the latest middle Miocene as a consequence of subduction of the narrow Calabrian slab and the immobility of the subducting African plate and overriding Eurasian plate. This setting induced strong trench suction, driving forearc extension, and forced subduction to be accommodated almost entirely by slab rollback (not trenchward subducting plate motion), while trench retreat was accommodated almost entirely by back-arc and fore-arc extension (not trenchward overriding plate motion), comparable to our SP-OP-Fixed model.},

The role of these suture zones in the evolution of the Himalayan range and Tibetan plateau remains unclear. Here we use 3-D thermomechanical simulations to investigate the role of pre-existing weak zones within the Asian Plate in the formation of orogen and plateau growth during continental collision. Our results show that partitioning of deformation along the convergent margin leads to scraping off of crustal material into an orogenic wedge above the margin and crustal thickening in the retro-continent, eventually forming a large orogenic plateau in front of the indenter. Pre-existing weak zone(s) within the retro-continent is reactivated at the early stage of convergence, and facilitates the northward propagation of strain and widening of the orogenic plateau. The northernmost weak zone sets the northern limit of the Tibetan plateau. Our models also show rheological weakening of the congested buoyant crust within the collisional zone drives wedge-type exhumation of deeply buried crust at the southern flank of the plateau, which may explain the formation of the Greater Himalayan Sequence.},

Based on a total of 13,397 borehole packer test data collected at 12 high dam sites in Southwest China, the statistical distribution of hydraulic conductivity of rocks in this deep-incised valley area was investigated using hypothesis test, regression analysis and semi-variogram analysis, showing that the hydraulic conductivity of igneous and metamorphic rocks at various depths in the study area follows a log-normal distribution within 600 m depth. The vertical variation in hydraulic conductivity K [m/s] and standard deviation of lgK with depth d [m] can be best described by the power function K = 2 {\texttimes} 10-6d-0.48 and the logistic function {$\sigma$}lgK = 0.6/[1 + (d/428)4.7]. It is deduced that the decreasing degree of weathering and unloading from ground surface to unaltered fresh rocks leads to reduction in the geometric mean of hydraulic conductivity by about 1--2 orders of magnitude. The hydraulic conductivity of rocks in the study area is more controlled by geologic structures of various origins and scales and less by lithology. The compiled data and analysis presented in this study provide a reference for calibration of catchment hydrological models as well as parameterization of surface water-groundwater interactions in mountainous regions.},

  abstract = {The Caledonides of Britain and Ireland are one of the most intensively studied orogenic belts in the world. This review considers all the tectonic events associated with the development and closure of the Iapetus Ocean. It first summarizes the tectonic evolution of each segment involved in the Scottish-Irish sector of the Caledonides and then reviews the temporal evolution of the Caledonian Orogeny. Three main tectonic phases are recognized in the Scottish-Irish Caledonides: an Early-Middle Ordovician (475-465 Ma) phase termed the Grampian Orogeny; a phase of Silurian (435-425 Ma) tectonism restricted to the Northern Highland Terrane of Scotland termed the Scandian Orogeny; and an Early Devonian (395 Ma) phase termed the Acadian Orogeny. The Grampian Orogeny was caused by the collision of the Laurentian continental margin with an oceanic arc terrane and associated suprasubduction zone ophiolites during the latest Cambrian-Early Ordovician. Following the Grampian arc-continent collision event, there was a subduction polarity reversal. This facilitated continued subduction of Iapetan oceanic lithosphere and an Andean-type continental margin developed on and adjacent to the Laurentian margin in the Middle Ordovician along with a substantial thickness of accretionary prism sediments (the Southern Uplands-Longford Down Terrane). The Iapetus Ocean is believed to have disappeared by the Late Silurian based on the faunal record and a continent-continent collision ensued. The absence of significant regional deformation and metamorphism associated with the Late Silurian collision between Avalonia and the Scottish-Irish margin of Laurentia suggests that the continental collision in this sector of the Caledonian-Appalachian orogen was 'soft' or highly oblique. The exception is the Northern Highlands Terrane of Scotland that was believed to have been situated 500-700 km to the north along orogenic strike. This terrane records evidence for significant Silurian regional deformation and metamorphism attributed to the collision of the Laurentian margin of East Greenland with Baltica (the Scandian Orogeny). Current controversies in the Laurentian Caledonides of Scotland and Ireland are discussed at the end of this review.},

The OCT on present-day margins is difficult to sample, and so much of our knowledge on the detailed nature of OCT sequences comes from obducted, magma-poor OCT ophiolites such as those preserved in the upper portions of the Alpine fold-and-thrust belt. Allochthonous, lens-shaped bodies of ultramafic rock are common in many other ancient orogenic belts, such as the Caledonian -- Appalachian orogen, yet their origin and tectonic significance remains uncertain. We summarize the occurrences of potential ancient OCTs within this orogen, commencing with Laurentian margin sequences where an OCT has previously been inferred (the Dalradian Supergroup of Scotland and Ireland and the Birchy Complex of Newfoundland). We then speculate on the origin of isolated occurrences of Alpine-type peridotite within Laurentian margin sequences in Quebec -- Vermont and Virginia -- North Carolina, focusing on rift-related units of Late Neoproterozoic age (so as to eliminate a Taconic ophiolite origin). A combination of poor exposure and pervasive Taconic deformation means that origin and emplacement of many ultramafic bodies in the Appalachians will remain uncertain. Nevertheless, the common occurrence of OCT-like rocks along the whole length of the Appalachian -- Caledonian margin of Laurentia suggests that the opening of the Iapetus Ocean may have been accompanied by hyperextension and the formation of magma-poor margins along many segments. SOMMAIRE Des travaux d'imagerie sismique et des forages profonds ont montr{\'e} que la transition oc{\'e}an-continent (OCT) de marges continentales de divergence pauvre en magma expos{\'e}e de nos jours, correspond {\`a} une zone d'hyper-{\'e}tirement tectonique caract{\'e}ris{\'e}e par un amincissement extr{\^e}me de la cro{\^u}te continentale, qui a exhum{\'e} sur le fond marin, jusqu'{\`a} la tranche la plus profonde de la cro{\^u}te continentale, voire du manteau continental serpentinis{\'e}. Parce qu'on peut difficilement {\'e}chantillonner l'OCT sur les marges actuelles, une grande partie de notre compr{\'e}hension des d{\'e}tails de la nature de l'OCT provient d'ophiolites pauvres en magma d'une OCT obduite, comme celles pr{\'e}serv{\'e}es dans les portions sup{\'e}rieures de la bande pliss{\'e}e alpine. Des masses lenticulaires de roches ultramafiques allochtones sont communes dans de nombreuses autres bandes orog{\'e}niques anciennes, comme l'orog{\`e}ne Cal{\'e}donienne-Appalaches, mais leur origine et signification tectonique reste incertaine.

  abstract = {We review the foundations and applications of the proper generalized decomposition (PGD), a powerful model reduction technique that computes a priori by means of successive enrichment a separated representation of the unknown field. The computational complexity of the PGD scales linearly with the dimension of the space wherein the model is defined, which is in marked contrast with the exponential scaling of standard grid-based methods. First introduced in the context of computational rheology by Ammar et al. [3,4], the PGD has since been further developed and applied in a variety of applications ranging from the solution of the Schr{\"o}dinger equation of quantum mechanics to the analysis of laminate composites. In this paper, we illustrate the use of the PGD in four problem categories related to computational rheology: (i) the direct solution of the Fokker-Planck equation for complex fluids in configuration spaces of high dimension, (ii) the development of very efficient non-incremental algorithms for transient problems, (iii) the fully three-dimensional solution of problems defined in degenerate plate or shelllike domains often encountered in polymer processing or composites manufacturing, and finally (iv) the solution of multidimensional parametric models obtained by introducing various sources of problem variability as additional coordinates.},

  abstract = {The basal depth of the outer layer with internal magnetic sources was calculated from magnetic data available within a roughly 500km wide and 1200km long area, running from central Germany to southern Italy. The dataset, deriving from different aeromagnetic surveys, is reduced to the reference altitude of 3000m a.s.l. and a reference year of 1980.0. The adopted method, which transforms the spatial data into the frequency domain, provides a relationship between the two-dimensional spectrum of the magnetic anomalies and the top and centroid depths of the magnetic sources. The magnetic layer bottom depth (MLBD) thus obtained is 29--33km deep in the stable areas (central Europe Variscan units, Corsica--Sardinia Variscan block) and corresponds to the Moho, having an average temperature of 560{$^\circ$}C. From the Alps to the Apennines, MLBD ranges between 22 and 28km and is clearly shallower than the Moho. In these units, the wide variation of MLBD appears to be compatible with the presence of shallow magnetised bodies, consisting of lower crustal rocks (Ivrea--Verbano zone), ophiolitic units (Penninic zone and Voltri Massif) and intrasedimentary basic volcanic bodies (Po Basin). An average value of 25km can be attributed to MLBD, which corresponds to a temperature of 550{$^\circ$}C. In the peri-Tyrrhenian zone and the Ligurian Sea, MLBD is below the Moho, which ranges from 17 to 20km depth, and it has a temperature matching approximately to the Curie temperature of magnetite (580{$^\circ$}C).},

  abstract = {Early magnetic studies of the Japan Trench showed that seafloor spreading magnetic anomalies progressively fade away and disappear during subduction, reflecting the increasing distance to magnetized sources and the removal of their remanent magnetization with alteration and increasing temperature. An improved magnetic anomaly map derived from both scalar and vector magnetic anomaly data, coupled with a better knowledge of the slab geometry in one hand, of the magnetic structure of the oceanic crust on the other hand, allow us to constrain the thermal structure of the subducting slab. We, for the first time, identify two steps in the anomaly disappearance: first the magnetization of extrusive basalt is rapidly erased between 9 and 12 km, where titanomagnetite reaches its blocking temperature between 150 {$^\circ$}C and 350 {$^\circ$}C, then the magnetization of deeper crustal layers slowly decreases down to {$\sim$}20 km, reflecting the progressive slab heating toward the Curie temperature of magnetite, 580 {$^\circ$}C. The resulting slab temperatures are higher than predicted by most thermal models. Recent observations and models suggest rejuvenated hydrothermal activity triggered by lithospheric flexure before subduction that may significantly heat up the subducting oceanic crust through thermal blanketing and possibly serpentinization, with consequences on the depth of the seismogenic zone.}

One method to estimate the Curie depth for Australia is to map the base of magnetisation derived from observations of magnetic intensity. We have used a nonlinear direct sampling inverse technique to fully explore the parameter space of a fractal forward model of magnetisation. This produces an ensemble of models that allow us to produce maps of both the maximum depth of magnetisation and its uncertainty for Australia. The base of magnetisation varies significantly across the continent, between 10 and 70 km depth, with an uncertainty of 7-10 km. The variations in magnetisation depth conform with the boundaries of geological provinces due to their differing magnetic properties: In general, cratons and older provinces generally show a deeper base of magnetisation results and hence may be inferred to have deeper Curie depths, reflecting that these areas are on the whole cooler. We also find general agreement in our results with known geothermal anomalies.},

However, the fluxes of nutrients via submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) often exceed riverine inputs in different local and regional scale settings. In this study, we provide a first approximation of global nutrient fluxes to the ocean via total SGD, including pore water fluxes, by combining a global compilation of nutrient concentrations in groundwater and the SGD-derived 228Ra fluxes. In order to avoid overestimations in calculating SGD-derived nutrient fluxes, the endmember value of nutrients in global groundwater was chosen from saline groundwater samples (salinity {\textbackslash}textgreater10) which showed relatively lower values over all regions. The results show that the total SGD-derived fluxes of DIN, DIP, and DSi could be approximately 1.4-, 1.6-, and 0.7-fold of the river fluxes to the global ocean (Indo-Pacific and Atlantic Oceans), respectively. Although significant portions of these SGD-derived nutrient fluxes are thought to be recycled within sediment-aquifer systems over various timescales, SGD-derived nutrient fluxes should be included in the global ocean budget in order to better understand dynamic interactions at the land-ocean interface.}

  abstract = {Seismic techniques provide the highest-resolution measurements of the structure of the crust and have been conducted on a worldwide basis. We summarize the structure of the continental crust based on the results of seismic refraction profiles and infer crustal composition as a function of depth by comparing these results with high-pressure laboratory measurements of seismic velocity for a wide range of rocks that are commonly found in the crust. The thickness and velocity structure of the crust are well correlated with tectonic province, with extended crust showing an average thickness of 30.5 km and orogens an average of 46.3 km. Shields and platforms have an average crustal thickness nearly equal to the global average. We have corrected for the nonuniform geographical distribution of seismic refraction profiles by estimating the global area of each major crustal type. The weighted average crustal thickness based on these values is 41.1 km. This value is 10\% to 20\% greater than previous estimates which underrepresented shields, platforms, and orogens. The average compressional wave velocity of the crust is 6.45 km/s, and the average velocity of the uppermost mantle (Pn velocity) is 8.09 km/s. We summarize the velocity structure of the crust at 5-km depth intervals, both in the form of histograms and as an average velocity-depth curve, and compare these determinations with new measurements of compressional wave velocities and densities of over 3000 igneous and metamorphic rock cores made to confining pressures of 1 GPa. On the basis of petrographic studies and chemical analyses, the rocks have been classified into 29 groups. Average velocities, densities, and standard deviations are presented for each group at 5-km depth intervals to crustal depths of 50 km along three different geotherms. This allows us to develop a model for the composition of the continental crust. Velocities in the upper continental crust are matched by velocities of a large number of lithologies, including many low-grade metamorphic rocks and relatively silicic gneisses of amphibolite facies grade. In midcrustal regions, velocity gradients appear to originate from an increase in metamorphic grade, as well as a decrease in silica content. Tonalitic gneiss, granitic gneiss, and amphibolite are abundant midcrustal lithologies. Anisotropy due to preferred mineral orientation is likely to be significant in upper and midcrustal regions. The bulk of the lower continental crust is chemically equivalent to gabbro, with velocities in agreement with laboratory measurements of mafic granulite. Garnet becomes increasingly abundant with depth, and mafic garnet granulite is the dominant rock type immediately above the Mohorovicic discontinuity. Average compressional wave velocities of common crustal rock types show excellent correlations with density. The mean crustal density calculated from our model is 2830 kg/m3, and the average SiO2 content is 61.8\%.},

We derive a computationally efficient adjoint-state method for the sensitivities of the temporal moments that require the solution of the steady-state flow equation and two steady-state transport equations for the forward problem and the same number of equations for each first-moment measurement. The efficiency of the method makes it feasible to evaluate the sensitivity matrix many times in large domains. We incorporate our approach for the calculation of sensitivities in the quasi-linear geostatistical method of inversing (``iterative cokriging''). The application to an artificial example of a tracer introduced into an injection well shows good convergence behavior when both head and first-moment data are used for inversing, whereas inversing of arrival times alone is less stable.},

  abstract = {Trench rollback has been a widely discussed phenomenon in recent years, and multiple studies have concentrated on various parameters that may influence trench migration and related aspects of slab deformation in the (upper) mantle. Here we concentrate on the effects of rheological description (yield stress, lower-mantle viscosity, viscosity of crust) in controlling the rollback and associated stagnation of slabs in the transition zone (410-660 km depth). We perform numerical simulations of slab evolution in a 2D Cartesian model with strongly nonlinear rheology combining diffusion creep, dislocation creep and a power-law stress limiter. We demonstrate that trench retreat develops in most models considered, regardless of the subducting plate age or prescribed strength. Rollback then mostly produces slabs that are horizontally deflected at the 660-km phase boundary and remain subhorizontal at the bottom of the transition zone. Slab morphologies are in agreement with stagnant, horizontally deflected structures reported in the transition zone by seismic tomography. Furthermore, if the strength of the slab is limited to less than 0.5 GPa, the slab experiences a significant amount of horizontal buckling. The amplitude of the rollback velocity is sensitive to several model parameters. As one might expect, it increases with the age of the subducting plate, thus reflecting its increasingly negative buoyancy. On the other hand, rollback velocity decreases if we increase the viscosity of the crust and thereby strengthen the coupling between the subducting and overriding plates. High friction on the contact between the subducting and overriding plates may even result in slabs penetrating into the lower mantle after a period of temporary stagnation. Also, reducing the additional negative buoyancy imparted by the 410-km exothermic phase transition suppresses trench rollback. Interpretation of the controls on slab rollback and stagnation may be rather complex in strongly nonlinear rheological models, where, for example, buoyancy effects may be counteracted by associated yield-stress weakening. {\copyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {A consistent, agreed-upon terminology is prerequisite for geothermal resource assessment. Accordingly, we propose a logical, sequential subdivision of the "'geothermal resource base", accepting its definition as all the thermal energy in the earth's crust under a given area, measured from mean annual temperature. That part of the resource base which is shallow enough to be tapped by production drilling is termed the "accessible resource base r , and it in turn is divided into "useful" and "residual" components. The useful component (i.e. the thermal energy that could reasonably be extracted at costs competitive with other forms of energy at some specified future time) is termed the "'geothermal resource". This in turn is divided into "'economic" and "subeconomic" components, based on conditions existing at the time of assessment. In the format of a McKelvey diagram, this logic defines the vertical axis tdegree of economic feasibility). The horizontal axis (degree of geologic assurance) contains "identified" and "undiscovered" components. "Reserve" is then designated as the identified economic resource. All categories should be expressed in units of thermal energy, with resource and reserve figures calculated at wellhead, prior to the inevitable large losses inherent in any practical thermal use or in conversion to electricity. Methods for assessing geothermal resources can be grouped into 4 classes: la) surface thermal flux, (b) volume, (c) planar fracture and (d) magmatic heat budget.The volume method appears to be most usefu! because (1) it is applicable to virtually any geologic environment, (2\vphantom\{\} the required parameters can in principle be measured or estimated, (3) the inevitable errors are in part compensated and 14) the major uncertainties (recoverability and resupply) are amenable to resolution in the foreseeable future. The major weakness in all the methods rests in the estimation of how much of the accessible resource base can be extracted at some time in the future. In a manner similar to mineral and fuel assessment, this recoverability is expr{$\sim$}sed as a "recovery factor". For an ideally permeable hot-water system, the recovery factor may be as much as 50{$\sim$},{$\sim$}, and seems to be independent of temperature. It must decrease as effective porosity ({$\sim$}b,) decreases, but the relation between the two is little more than a guess. On the other hand, for favorable systems like Larderello that produce steam by a mechanism of intergranular vaporization, the recovery factor is probably around 15-20",, decreasing to zero at an ellectwe porosity of zero.

Because the lack of significant upper crustal shortening across much of the eastern plateau margin implies that the crustal thickening occurs mainly in the deep crust, we compare regional topographic gradients surrounding the plateau to model results for flux of a Newtonian fluid through a lower crustal channel of uniform thickness. For an assumed 15-km-thick channel, we estimate a viscosity for the lower crust of 1018 Pa{$\cdot$}s beneath the low-gradient margins, 1021 Pa{$\cdot$}s beneath the steep margins, and an upper bound of 1016 Pa{$\cdot$}s beneath the plateau. These results indicate that the large-scale morphology of the eastern plateau reflects fluid flow within the underlying crust; crustal material flows around the strong crust of the Sichuan and Tarim Basins, creating broad, gentle margins, and ``piles up'' behind the basins creating narrow, steep margins. These results imply that this portion of the Eurasian crust was heterogeneous, but largely weak, even prior to construction of the Tibetan Plateau.},

Deep basins on the northern margin of the South China Sea, notably the Baiyun Sag, show basement subsidence accelerating after {$\sim$}21 Ma, postdating extension by several million years. We combine geophysical observations and numerical forward modeling to show that loading of the offshore basins by increased sediment flux caused by faster onshore erosion following Early Miocene monsoon intensification is a viable trigger for ductile flow after the cessation of active extension. This illustrates that offshore basin dynamics at continental margins with weak crust can be controlled by onshore surface processes in a newly recognized form of climate-tectonic coupling.},

  abstract = {Documenting the mass flux through convergent plate margins is important to the understanding of petrogenesis in arc settings and to the origin of the continental crust, since subduction zones are the only major routes by which material extracted from the mantle can be returned to great depths within the Earth. Despite their significance, there has been a tendency to view subduction zones as areas of net crustal growth. Convergent plate margins are divided into those showing long-term landward retreat of the trench and those dominated by accretion of sediments from the subducting plate. Tectonic erosion is favored in regions where convergence rates exceed 6 {\textpm} 0.1 cm yr -1 and where the sedimentary cover is {\textbackslash}textless1 km. Accretion preferentially occurs in regions of slow convergence ({\textbackslash}textless7.6 cm yr-1) and/or trench sediment thicknesses {\textbackslash}textgreater1 km. Large volumes of continental crust are subducted at both erosive and accretionary margins. Average magmatic productivity of arcs must exceed 90 km3 m.y.-1 if the volume of the continental crust is to be maintained. Convergence rate rather than height of the melting column under the arc appears to be the primary control on long-term melt production. Oceanic arcs will not be stable if crustal thicknesses exceed 36 km or trench retreat rates are {\textbackslash}textgreater6 km m.y.-1. Continental arcs undergoing erosion are major sinks of continental crust. This loss requires that oceanic arcs be accreted to the continental margins if the net volume of crust is to be maintained.

  abstract = {Carbon plays a pivotal role in governing the climate and biosphere of Earth, yet quantification of carbon's long-term cycling from the mantle to the surface remains contentious. Sedimentary carbon represents a significant part of the budget and can be recycled to the mantle if underthrust in subduction zones. I estimate that {$\sim$}60 megaton per year (Mt/yr) is presently being subducted below the outer fore arc, 80\% in the form of carbonate carbon, significantly more than previously estimated. Sedimentary carbon represents around two thirds of the total carbon input at the trenches. An additional 7 Mt/yr is averaged over the Cenozoic as a result of passive margin subduction during continental collision ({$\sim$}83\% CaCO3). This revision brings the input and output budgets within the range of uncertainty. Degassing from arc volcanoes and fore arcs totals {$\sim$}55 Mt/yr. When carbon in hydrothermal veins in the altered oceanic crust and serpentinized upper mantle is accounted for, a net flux to the mantle appears likely. The efficiency of carbon subduction is largely controlled by the carbonate contents of the sediment column and is partly linked to the latitude of the trench. Accretionary margins are the biggest suppliers of carbon to the mantle wedge, especially Java, Sumatra, Andaman-Burma, and Makran, reflecting the inefficiency of offscraping, the thickness of the subducting sediment, and the trench length. The western Pacific trenches are negligible sinks of sedimentary carbon. Increases in deep-sea carbonate in the Oligocene and middle Mesozoic had a large impact on the subduction budget, increasing it greatly compared to earlier times.},

  abstract = {We investigate the crustal structure of the Australian continent using the temporary broadband stations of the Skippy and Kimba projects and permanent broadband stations. We isolate near-receiver information, in the form of crustal P-to-S conversions, using the receiver function technique. Stacked receiver functions are inverted for S velocity structure using a Genetic Algorithm approach to Receiver Function Inversion (GARFI). From the resulting velocity models we are able to determine the Moho depth and to classify the width of the crust-mantle transition for 65 broadband stations. Using these results and 51 independent estimates of crustal thickness from refraction and reflection profiles, we present a new, improved, map of Moho depth for the Australian continent. The thinnest crust (25 km) occurs in the Archean Yilgarn Craton in Western Australia; the thickest crust (61 km) occurs in Proterozoic central Australia. The average crustal thickness is 38.8 km (standard deviation 6.2 km). Interpolation error estimates are made using kriging and fall into the range 2.5--7.0 km. We find generally good agreement between the depth to the seismologically defined Moho and xenolith-derived estimates of crustal thickness beneath northeastern Australia. However, beneath the Lachlan Fold Belt the estimates are not in agreement, and it is possible that the two techniques are mapping differing parts of a broad Moho transition zone. The Archean cratons of Western Australia appear to have remained largely stable since cratonization, reflected in only slight variation of Moho depth. The largely Proterozoic center of Australia shows relatively thicker crust overall as well as major Moho offsets. We see evidence of the margin of the contact between the Precambrian craton and the Tasman Orogen, referred to as the Tasman Line.},

To reach this conclusion, we tried to establish how many of the seamount alignments on the Pacific plate correspond to classic hotspots, i.e., long-lived hotspots linked to oceanic basaltic plateaus. We retraced the tracks of the 14 Pacific hotspots by using (1) the absolute stage poles representing the Pacific plate absolute motion since 145 Ma, (2) an updated compilation of radiometric ages of seamounts and oceanic plateaus totaling 266 seamounts or islands, (3) the detailed bathymetry of the Pacific Ocean, and (4) the present locations of the hotspots. This analysis allowed us to correlate only three hotspots with the beginning of their tracks possibly corresponding in space and time to an oceanic plateau: Easter to the eastern Mid-Pacific Mountains, Louisville to the Ontong Java plateau, and, with less confidence, Marquesas to Hess Rise and Shatsky Ridge. In addition, the Hawaii hotspot has produced long-lived volcanism. These four are the only classic hotspots on the Pacific plate. However, seven hotspots present short tracks (35 m.y.) that cannot be traced to an oceanic plateau and thus are not related to any deep-mantle phenomena: Foundation, Macdonald, Pitcairn, Rarotonga, Rurutu, Samoa, and Society. The two northeast Pacific hotspots, Kodiak-Bowie and Cobb, and the Caroline hotspot are unclassifiable because of close proximity to a subduction zone where the prior history of volcanism has been lost},

Despite this abundance of young volcanism, before this study numerous eruptions had tentative ages or were undated, and the area requires a comprehensive evaluation of eruption patterns through time. To help address these issues we applied multi-collector ARGUS-V 40Ar/39Ar geochronology to determine the age of four of the younger extensive flows: Undara (160 km long, 189 {\textpm} 4/4 ka; 2{$\sigma$}, with full analytical/external uncertainties), Murronga (40 km long, 153 {\textpm} 5/5 ka), Toomba (120 km long, 21 {\textpm} 3/3 ka), and Kinrara (55 km long, 7 {\textpm} 2/2 ka). Verbal traditions of the Gugu Badhun Aboriginal people contain features that may potentially describe the eruption of Kinrara. If the traditions do record this eruption, they would have been passed down for 230 {\textpm} 70 generations -- a period of time exceeding the earliest written historical records. To further examine north Queensland volcanism through time we compiled a database of 337 ages, including 179 previously unpublished K-Ar and radiocarbon results. The compiled ages demonstrate that volcanic activity has occurred without major time breaks since at least 9 Ma. The greatest frequency of eruptions occurred in the last 2 Ma, with an average recurrence interval of {\textbackslash}textless10--22 ka between eruptions. Activity was at times likely more frequent than these calculations indicate, as the geochronologic dataset is incomplete, with undated eruptions, and intraplate volcanism is often episodic. The duration, frequency, and youthfulness of activity indicate that north Queensland volcanism should be considered as potentially still active, and there are now two confirmed areas of Holocene volcanism in eastern Australia -- one at each end of the continent. More broadly, our data provides another example of 40Ar/39Ar geochronology applied to Holocene and latest Pleistocene mafic eruptions, further demonstrating that this method has the ability to examine eruptions and hazards at the youngest volcanoes on Earth.},

  abstract = {Wave propagational inverse problems arise in several applications including medical imaging and geophysical exploration. In these problems, one is interested in obtaining the parameters describing the medium from its response to excitations. The problems are characterized by their large size, and by the hyperbolic equation which models the physical phenomena. The inverse problems are often posed as a nonlinear data-fitting where the unknown parameters are found by minimizing the misfit between the predicted data and the actual data. In order to solve the problem numerically using a gradient-type approach, one must calculate the action of the Jacobian and its adjoint on a given vector. In this paper, we explore the use of automatic differentiation (AD) to develop codes that perform these calculations. We show that by exploiting structure at 2 scales, we can arrive at a very efficient code whose main components are produced by AD. In the first scale we exploite the time-stepping nature of the hyperbolic solver by using the ``Extended Jacobian'' framework. In the second (finer) scale, we exploit the finite difference stencil in order to make explicit use of the sparsity in the dependence of the output variables to the input variables. The main ideas in this work are illustrated with a simpler, one-dimensional version of the problem. Numerical results are given for both one- and two- dimensional problems. We present computational templates that can be used in conjunction with optimization packages to solve the inverse problem.},

  abstract = {Many granulite terrains were too hot to have formed during continental collision. Rather, along with many high-grade metamorphic terrains that typify continental crust, most formed in accretionary orogens during tectonic switching, when prolonged lithospheric extension was interrupted by intermittent, transient contraction. Based on modern and ancient examples, tectonic switching occurs when slab retreat induces upper plate extension, causing arc splitting, formation of microcontinent slivers, and backarc basins; then intermittent arrival of buoyant oceanic plateaus induces transient flat subduction (or slab flip) and crustal thickening. During slab retreat, basaltic magmas produced from decompressed asthenosphere advect into the extending orogen, causing granulite facies metamorphism and granite generation, but subsequent thickening during flat subduction cools the region. Thickening is focused in the thermally softened backarc region and, if sediment filled, a hot, short-lived ( approximately 10 m.y.), narrow (50- 100 km) orogenic belt forms. Such thickening is often misleadingly ascribed to arc or microcontinent collision. Once slab-retreat mode is reestablished, lithospheric extension recommences and a new arc-backarc system forms, generally outboard. Arrival of another plateau will reverse the procedure, and another short-lived, hot orogen will form within the orogenic system. Cycles of tectonic switching efficiently produce continental crust.},

  abstract = {Although mantle convection at Earth-like vigor is a chaotic process, it has been shown by conceptual studies that one can constrain its flow history back in time for periods comparable to a mantle overturn, {$\approx$}100million years, if knowledge of the tangential surface velocity field and estimates on the present-day heterogeneity state are available. Such retrodictions, enabled through computationally demanding adjoint methods, are a promising tool to improve our understanding of deep Earth processes, and to link uncertain geodynamic modeling parameters to geologic observables. Here we present the first mantle flow retrodictions for geodynamically plausible, compressible, high resolution Earth models with {$\approx$}670 million finite elements, going back in time to the Mid Paleogene. Our retrodictions involve the dynamic effects from a low viscosity zone (LVZ) in the upper mantle, assimilate a past plate motion model for the tangential surface velocity field, and probe the influence from uncertain modeling parameters by using two different estimates for the present-day heterogeneity state of the mantle as imaged by two recent seismic tomographic studies, and two different values for deep mantle viscosity. Focusing on the African hemisphere, we find that our retrodictions produce a spatially and temporally highly variable asthenosphere flow with faster-than-plate velocities, and a history of dynamic topography characterized by local doming events, in agreement with considerations on plate driving forces, and regional scale uplifts reported in the geologic literature. Our results suggest that improved constraints on non-isostatic vertical motion of Earth's surface --- provided, for instance, by basin analysis, seismic stratigraphy, landform studies, or the sedimentation record --- will play an important role in our understanding of the recent mantle flow history.},

The present-day distribution suggests that subduction affects lithosphere of all ages, but this is at odds with the theory of thermal convection that predicts that subduction should happen once a critical age has been reached. We used spherical models of mantle convection to show that plate-like behavior and continents cause the seafloor area-age distribution to be representative of present-day Earth. The distribution varies in time with the creation and destruction of new plate boundaries.

  abstract = {Continents episodically cluster together into a supercontinent, eventually breaking up with intense magmatic activity supposedly caused by mantle plumes (Morgan, 1983; Richards et al., 1989; Condie, 2004). The breakup of Pangea, the last supercontinent, was accompanied by the emplacement of the largest known continental flood basalt, the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province, which caused massive extinctions at the Triassic-Jurassic boundary (Marzoli et al., 1999). However, there is little support for a plume origin for this catastrophic event (McHone, 2000). On the basis of convection modeling in an internally heated mantle, this paper shows that continental aggregation promotes large-scale melting without requiring the involvement of plumes. When only internal heat sources in the mantle are considered, the formation of a supercontinent causes the enlargement of flow wavelength and a subcontinental increase in temperature as large as 100 degrees C. This temperature increase may lead to large-scale melting without the involvement of plumes. Our results suggest the existence of two distinct types of continental flood basalts, caused by plume or by mantle global warming.},

  abstract = {Throughout its history, the Earth has experienced global magmatic events that correlate with the formation of supercontinents. This suggests that the distribution of continents at the Earth's surface is fundamental in regulating mantle temperature. Nevertheless, most large igneous provinces (LIPs) are explained in terms of the interaction of a hot plume with the lithosphere, even though some do not show evidence for such a mechanism. The aggregation of continents impacts on the temperature and flow of the underlying mantle through thermal insulation and enlargement of the convection wavelength. Both processes tend to increase the temperature below the continental lithosphere, eventually triggering melting events without the involvement of hot plumes. This model, called mantle global warming, has been tested using 3D numerical simulations of mantle convection [Coltice, N., Phillips, B. R., Bertrand, H., Ricard, Y., Rey, P. (2007) Global warming of the mantle at the origin of flood basalts over supercontinents. Geology 35, 391-394.]. Here, we apply this model to several continental flood basalts (CFBs) ranging in age from the Mesozoic to the Archaean. Our numerical simulations show that the mantle global warming model could account for the peculiarities of magmatic provinces that developed during the formation of Pangea and Rodinia, as well as putative Archaean supercontinents such as Kenorland and Zimvaalbara.},

  abstract = {The concept of interplay between mantle convection and tectonics goes back to about a century ago, with the proposal that convection currents in the Earth's mantle drive continental drift and deformation (Holmes, 1931). Since this time, plate tectonic theory has established itself as the fundamental framework to study surface deformation, with the remarkable ability to encompass geological and geophysical observations. Mantle convection modeling has progressed to the point where connections with plate tectonics can be made, pushing the idea that tectonics is a surface expression of the global dynamics of one single system: the mantle-lithosphere system. Here, we present our perspective, as modelers, on the dynamics behind global tectonics with a focus on the importance of self-organisation. We first present an overview of the links between mantle convection and tectonics at the present-day, examining observations such as kinematics, stress and deformation. Despite the numerous achievements of geodynamic studies, this section sheds light on the lack of self-organisation of the models used, which precludes investigations of the feedbacks and evolution of the mantle-lithosphere system. Therefore, we review the modeling strategies, often focused on rheology, that aim at taking into account self-organisation. The fundamental objective is that plate-like behaviour emerges self-consistently in convection models. We then proceed with the presentation of studies of continental drift, seafloor spreading and plate tectonics in convection models allowing for feedbacks between surface tectonics and mantle dynamics. We discuss the approximation of the rheology of the lithosphere used in these models (pseudo-plastic rheology), for which empirical parameters differ from those obtained in experiments. In this section, we analyse in detail a state-of-the-art 3-D spherical convection calculation, which exhibits fundamental tectonic features (continental drift, one-sided subduction, trench and ridge evolution, transform shear zones, small-scale convection, and plume tectonics). This example leads to a discussion where we try to answer the following question: can mantle convection models transcend the limitations of plate tectonic theory?},

We contribute to this ongoing debate, using the Nd isotopic compositions of felsic igneous rocks and their distribution during the accretionary and collisional phases of orogens. The proportion of juvenile input into the continental crust is estimated with a mixing model using arc-like mantle and reworked continental crust end members. Orogen length and duration proxies for juvenile crustal volume show that the amount of juvenile crust produced and preserved at zircon age peaks during the accretionary phase of orogens is {$\geq$}3 times that preserved during the collisional phase of orogens. The fact that most juvenile crust is both produced and preserved during the accretionary phase of orogens does not require craton collisions for its preservation, thus favoring the interpretation of zircon age peaks as crustal production peaks. Most juvenile continental crust older than 600 Ma is produced and preserved before final supercontinent assembly and does not require supercontinent assembly for its preservation. Episodic destabilization of a compositionally heterogeneous layer at the base of the mantle may produce mantle plume events leading to enhanced subduction and crustal production. Our Nd isotope model for cumulative continental growth based on juvenile crust proxies for the past 2.5 b.y. suggests a step-like growth curve with rapid growth in accretionary orogens at the times of zircon age peaks.},

For example, it has no through-going miogeocline or foreland fold and thrust belt. Except for a narrow deformed fringe along its western margin the entire system is `suspect' in the sense that its paleogeography is uncertain through much of Paleozoic time. The tectonic evolution of the Tasman orogenic system is composed of four major phases. The first was a prolonged late Proterozoic-early Paleozoic period of variable tectonic settings characterized by generally deep-marine turbiditic sedimentation and submarine volcanism, and shifting, somewhat local, deformation, metamorphism and plutonism. The second epoch was a major mid-Paleozoic period of deformation, volcanism and plutonism that consolidated a belt of lower Paleozoic interior terranes into Australia. The third epoch was a major accretionary phase in the outer New England belt of terranes that culminated in late Paleozoic time, and continued into the early Mesozoic. The final epoch was extensional, and was due to the break-up of Gondwanaland in late Mesozoic time, continuing to the present. Tectonic evolution during the first three phases was somewhat similar to that of the remainder of the nearly 20,000 km long Pacific margin of Gondwanaland in the Andes and Antarctica, and suggests that `absolute' motions of Gondwanaland itself prior to break-up may have influenced the tectonics of its Pacific margin.}

The basis of the algorithm is the representation of the continuous compositional variations of solution phases by series of discrete compositions. As a consequence of this approximation the classical non-linear free energy minimization problem is trivially solved by linear programming. Phase relations are then mapped as a function of the variables of interest using bisection to locate phase boundaries. Treatment of isentropic and isothermal phase relations involving felsic and mafic silicate melts by this method is illustrated. To demonstrate the tractability of more complex problems involving mass transfer, a model for infiltration driven-decarbonation in subduction zones is evaluated. As concluded from earlier closed system models, the open-system model indicates that carbonates are likely to persist in the subducted oceanic crust beyond sub-arc depths even if the upper section of the oceanic mantle is extensively hydrated. However, in contrast to more simplistic models of slab devolatilization, the open-system model suggests slab fluid production is heterogeneous and ephemeral. Computed seismic velocity profiles, together with thermodynamic constraints, imply that for typical geothermal conditions serpentinization of the subducted mantle is unlikely to extend to {\textbackslash}textgreater25 km depth and that the average water-content of the serpentinized mantle is {\textbackslash}textless2 wt.\%.},

  abstract = {Geodynamic models commonly assume equations of state as a function of pressure and temperature. This form is legitimate for homogenous materials, but it is impossible to formulate a general equation of state for a polyphase aggregate, e. g., a rock, as a function of pressure and temperature because these variables cannot distinguish all possible states of the aggregate. In consequence, the governing equations of a geodynamic model based on a pressure-temperature equation of state are singular at the conditions of low-order phase transformations. An equation of state as a function of specific entropy, specific volume, and chemical composition eliminates this difficulty and, additionally, leads to a robust formulation of the energy and mass conservation equations. In this formulation, energy and mass conservation furnish evolution equations for entropy and volume and the equation of state serves as an update rule for temperature and pressure. Although this formulation is straightforward, the computation of phase equilibria as a function of entropy and volume is challenging because the equations of state for individual phases are usually expressed as a function of temperature and pressure. This challenge can be met by an algorithm in which continuous equations of state are approximated by a series of discrete states: a representation that reduces the phase equilibrium problem to a linear optimization problem that is independent of the functional form used for the equations of state of individual phases. Because the efficiency of the optimization decays as an exponential function of the dimension of the function to be optimized, direct solution of the linearized optimization problem is impractical. Successive linear programming alleviates this difficulty. A pragmatic alternative to optimization as an explicit function of entropy and volume is to calculate phase relations over the range of pressure-temperature conditions of interest. Numerical interpolation can then be used to generate tables for any thermodynamic property as a function of any choice of independent variables. Regardless of the independent variables of the governing equations, a consistent definition of pressure, and the coupling of equilibrium kinetics to deformation, is only possible if the continuity equation accounts for dilational strain.},

We compute seismic velocities from thermodynamic data for equilibrium metabasalt mineralogies, determined by free energy minimization, at subduction zone conditions. Lawsonite stability has a profound effect on seismic velocities of subducted oceanic metabasalts. Velocity reductions of 3-7\% are estimated for lawsonite-eclogites derived by metamorphism of hydrothermally altered oceanic basalt subducted along relatively cool geotherms, whereas a 2-4\% velocity increase is characteristic of anhydrous eclogites within the coesite stability field. The restricted depth extent of low-velocity layers is explicable through the influence of the coesite-stishovite transition, which reduces lawsonite stability at high pressure. This transition also increases the positive velocity anomaly in anhydrous eclogites to 4-6\%, an effect that may account for deep high-velocity layers. The quality of the match between the properties of lawsonite-eclogite and low-velocity layers supports the contention that significant quantities of volatiles are retained within the oceanic crust beyond sub-arc depths. Because the velocity anomalies are explicable in terms of equilibrium phase relations, we find no reason to invoke metastability of metamorphic reactions to explain the low-velocity layers. {\copyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

If a slab is mechanically attached to a subducting plate, it can exert a direct pull on the plate. Alternatively, a detached slab may drive a plate by exciting flow in the mantle that exerts a shear traction on the base of the plate. From the geologic history of subduction, we estimated the relative importance of "pull" versus "suction" for the present-day plates. Observed plate motions are best predicted if slabs in the upper mantle are attached to plates and generate slab pull forces that account for about half of the total driving force on plates. Slabs in the lower mantle are supported by viscous mantle forces and drive plates through slab suction.}

A few high-volume volcanic fields are observed both at plate boundaries and within plates, fed by plumes upwelling from the deep mantle1. The remaining volcanism is observed away from plate boundaries. It is typically basaltic, effusive and low volume, occurring within continental interiors2--7 or creating seamounts on the ocean floor8--11. This intraplate volcanism has been attributed to various localized processes12 such as cracking of the lithosphere8,13,14, small-scale convection in the mantle beneath the lithosphere15--17 or shear-induced melting of low-viscosity pockets of asthenospheric mantle that have become embedded along the base of the lithosphere18. Here we compare the locations of observed intraplate volcanism with global patterns of mantle flow from a numerical model. We find a correlation between recent continental and oceanic intraplate volcanism and areas of the asthenosphere that are experiencing rapid shear due to mantle convection. We detect particularly high correlations in the interior of the continents of western North America, eastern Australia, southern Europe and Antarctica, as well as west of the East Pacific Rise in the Pacific Ocean. We conclude that intraplate volcanism associated with mantle convection is best explained by melting caused by shear flow within the asthenosphere, whereas other localized processes are less important.}

  abstract = {We propose that subducting slabs may cause lithospheric removal by directing mantle flow along the craton margin. This process could carve and shape the cratons, leading to conditions that impact the overall (in)stability of the lithosphere. We use three-dimensional geodynamic models to investigate how subduction-driven directed flow interacts with cratonic lithosphere of differing shape, concluding that the margin shape controls both channelization of flow around the craton as well as the potential for destruction. While the simulations show that all craton shapes aid in channelization, the cratons with straight vertical margins are the most resistant to deformation, and the cratons with gradually thickening margins are less resistant to deformation. The dependence on shape could contribute to the progressive removal of cratonic lithosphere along its margin in a runaway process until a more stable vertical margin shape evolves.},

Using constraints from the high-resolution Tellus aeromagnetic survey of Northern Ireland, we show that Palaeogene tectonics can be attributed to approximately north-south Alpine-related compression, forming NNW-SSE-trending dextral and ENE-WSW-trending sinistral conjugate strike-slip faults, with the latter defined by kilometre-scale displacements along reactivated Caledonian or Carboniferous faults. This tectonism was, however, punctuated by pulsed magmatic intrusive and extrusive events, including four distinct dyke swarms that are attributed to NE-SW-to east-west-directed plume-related extension. Although this evidence shows, for the first time, that north-south Alpine compression was periodically overwhelmed by the dynamic stresses and uplift associated with pulsed mantle plume-related deformation, associated strike-slip faulting may have controlled the locus of volcanic activity and central igneous complexes, and the location of sedimentary depocentres.},

  abstract = {Continental lithosphere houses the oldest and thickest regions of the Earth's surface. Locked within this deep and ancient rock record lies invaluable information about the dynamics that has shaped and continue to shape the planet. Much of that history has been dominated by the forces of plate tectonics which has repeatedly assembled super continents together and torn them apart - the Wilson Cycle. While the younger regions of continental lithosphere have been subject to deformation driven by plate tectonics, it is less clear whether the ancient, stable cores formed and evolved from similar processes. New insight into continental formation and evolution has come from remarkable views of deeper lithospheric structure using enhanced seismic imaging techniques and the increase in large volumes of broadband data. Some of the most compelling observations are that the continental lithosphere has a broad range in thicknesses ({$<$}100 to {$>$}300km), has complex internal structure, and that the thickest portion appears to be riddled with seismic discontinuities at depths between {\textasciitilde}80 and {\textasciitilde}130km. These internal structural features have been interpreted as remnants of lithospheric formation during Earth's early history. If they are remnants, then we can attempt to investigate the structure present in the deep lithosphere to piece together information about early Earth dynamics much as is done closer to the surface. This would help delineate between the differing models describing the dynamics of craton formation, particularly whether they formed in the era of modern plate tectonics, a transitional mobile-lid tectonic regime, or are the last fragments of an early, stagnant-lid planet. Our review paper (re)introduces readers to the conceptual definitions of the lithosphere and the complex nature of the upper boundary layer, then moves on to discuss techniques and recent seismological observations of the continental lithosphere. We then review geodynamic models and hypotheses for the formation of the continental lithosphere through time and implications for the formation and preservation of deep structure. These are contrasted with the dynamical picture of modern day continental growth during lateral accretion of juvenile crust with reference to examples from the Australian Tasmanides and the Alaskan accretionary margin.},

Here, we used radium isotopes to quantify SGD-derived fluxes of nitrogen, phosphorus and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) into Sydney Harbour estuary, Australia. Sydney is the most populated city of Oceania, with several localised cases of historical groundwater pollution. We sampled top and bottom waters at the harbour scale ({$\sim$}20 km) and also at four small scale embayments ({$\sim$}2 km). A decreasing gradient in radium isotope concentrations from upstream to downstream was observed. Mass balances constructed with 224Ra, 223Ra, and 226Ra revealed that total SGD ranged from 42 to 121 {\texttimes} 104 m3 d-1 depending on assumptions and isotope. These fluxes were related mostly to saline SGD (recirculated seawater), and are equivalent to {\textbackslash}textgreater60 times the mean annual freshwater river discharge into Sydney Harbour (0.68 {\texttimes} 104 m3 d-1). The estimated SGD rates (2.2 {\textpm} 1.5 cm d-1) were comparable to the global average radium-derived-SGD in other urban estuaries ({$\sim$}3.1 cm d-1). No obvious relationships were observed between SGD and scale in Sydney Harbour. However, higher SGD rates estimated for embayments closer to the ocean indicate that a combination of waves, tides and urbanization control SGD. SGD derived fluxes exceeded maximum riverine nutrient fluxes by a factor of 2 for DOC, 6 for PO43-, 40 for NH4+ and 1.3 for NOX. Previous work has suggested that nutrients enter Sydney Harbour primarily through rivers or stormwater following episodic rain events. Our results imply that diffuse saline SGD can also be an important but overlooked source of nutrients, potentially sustaining primary productivity in times of no river flow.},

Although its configuration at the time of breakup is widely accepted, there remains uncertainty about its configuration at the time of its amalgamation. The classic Pangaea-A model, widely known as "Wegenerian" configuration, implies that Pangaea did not deform internally between amalgamation and breakup. Palaeomagnetic studies suggest the possibility of a Pangaea-B configuration, in which Gondwana was located about 3000 km farther east relative to Laurasia compared its location in Pangaea-A. Here, we provide firm evidence of an Iberian-Appalachian connection in the Late Pennsylvanian (307-299 Ma) which confirms a Pangaea-A configuration for the relative locations of Gondwana and Laurasia in the late Palaeozoic, negating the possibility of Pangaea-B at that time. This evidence is based on palaeobotanical and biostratigraphic findings recently documented in the Carboniferous successions of Iberia (Douro Basin, Portugal). These new findings also precisely constrain the timing of uplift of the Appalachian and Iberian (Variscan) orogens and climatic changes during the amalgamation of Pangaea and final closure of the Rheic Ocean.}

A North American and a North Sea reservoir were investigated and empirical models specific to each reservoir show that 72\% and 73\% of the variance in initial water saturation can be explained by image data. The average amount that estimated initial water saturation differs from the experimentally measured initial water saturation is {\textpm} 3\% and {\textpm} 3.5\%, respectively, for the two reservoirs. It is also shown that the negative relationship between porosity or permeability and initial water saturation, which commonly have been used for prediction of saturation, are not universal but depend on the degree of pore size variation. Significant negative relationships between permeability and initial water saturation occur for rocks with relatively uniform pore systems but different pore sizes. For rocks with varying degrees of non-uniform pore systems, quantitative determination of pore structure is essential in order to estimate initial water saturation. The porosity classification technique used in this study is shown to be useful for determining the pore geometrical parameters which are significant for the prediction of initial water saturation. This technique could be used to evaluate initial water saturations of larger numbers of samples including samples too small for conventional testing.}

  abstract = {Abstract             High quality coastal aquifer systems provide vast quantities of potable groundwater for millions of people worldwide. Managing this setting has economic and environmental consequences. Specific knowledge of the dynamic relationship between fresh terrestrial groundwater discharging to the ocean and seawater intrusion is necessary. We present multi- disciplinary research that assesses the relationships between groundwater throughflow and seawater intrusion. This combines numerical simulation, geophysics, and analysis of more than 30 years of data from a seawater intrusion monitoring site. The monitoring wells are set in a shallow karstic aquifer system located along the southwest coast of Western Australia, where hundreds of gigalitres of fresh groundwater flow into the ocean annually. There is clear evidence for seawater intrusion along this coastal margin. We demonstrate how hydraulic anisotropy will impact on the landward extent of seawater for a given groundwater throughflow. Our examples show how the distance between the ocean and the seawater interface toe can shrink by over 100\% after increasing the rotation angle of hydraulic conductivity anisotropy when compared to a homogeneous aquifer. We observe extreme variability in the properties of the shallow aquifer from ground penetrating radar, hand samples, and hydraulic parameters estimated from field measurements. This motived us to complete numerical experiments with sets of spatially correlated random hydraulic conductivity fields, representative of karstic aquifers. The hydraulic conductivity proximal to the zone of submarine groundwater discharge is shown to be significant in determining the overall geometry and landward extent of the seawater interface. Electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) data was acquired and assessed for its ability to recover the seawater interface. Imaging outcomes from field ERI data are compared with simulated ERI outcomes derived from transport modelling with a range of hydraulic conductivity distributions. This process allows for interpretation of the approximate geometry of the seawater interface, however recovery of an accurate resistivity distribution across the wedge and mixing zone remains challenging. We reveal extremes in groundwater velocity, particularly where fresh terrestrial groundwater discharges to the ocean, and across the seawater recirculation cell. An overarching conclusion is that conventional seawater intrusion monitoring wells may not be suitable to constrain numerical simulation of the seawater intrusion. Based on these lessons, we present future options for groundwater monitoring that are specifically designed to quantify the distribution of; (i) high vertical and horizontal pressure gradients, (ii) sharp variations in subsurface flow velocity, (iii) extremes in hydraulic properties, and (iv) rapid changes in groundwater chemistry. These extremes in parameter distribution are common in karstic aquifer systems at the transition from land to ocean. Our research provides new insights into the behaviour of groundwater in dynamic, densely populated, and ecologically sensitive coastal environments found worldwide.},

Negative correlations between Fe3+/{$\sum$}Fe ratios and indices of mantle enrichment - such as 87Sr/86Sr, 208Pb/204Pb, Ba/La, and Nb/Zr ratios - reveal that enriched mantle is more reduced than depleted mantle. Because carbon may act to simultaneously reduce iron and generate melts that share geochemical traits with our reduced samples, we propose that carbon creates magmas at ridges that are reduced and enriched.}

Drainage network development, landsliding and sediment accumulation in response to faulting are calculated using CASCADE, a numerical model developed by Braun and Sambridge, and the results are compared with field examples. We first show theoretically how the 'fluvial length scale', L-f, in the fluvial incision algorithm can be related to the erodibility of the substrate and can be varied to mimic a range of river behaviour between detachment-limited (DL) and transport-limited (TL) end-member models for river incision. We also present new hydraulic geometry data from an extensional setting which show that channel width does not scale with drainage area where a channel incises through an area of active footwall uplift. We include this information in the coupled model, initially for a single value of L-f, and use it to demonstrate how fault interaction controls the location of the main drainage divide and thus the size of the footwall catchments that develop along an evolving basin-bounding normal fault. We show how erosion by landsliding and fluvial incision varies as the footwall area grows and quantify the volume, source area, and timing of sediment input to the hanging-wall basin through time. We also demonstrate how fault growth imposes a geometrical control on the scaling of river discharge with downstream distance within the footwall catchments, thus influencing the incision rate of rivers that drain into the hanging-wall basin. Whether these rivers continue to flow into the basin after the basin-bounding fault becomes fully linked strongly depends on the value of L-f. We show that such rivers are more likely to maintain their course if they are close to the TL end member (small L-f); as a river becomes progressively more under supplied, i.e. the DL end member (large L-f), it is more likely to be deflected or dammed by the growing fault. These model results are compared quantitatively with real drainage networks from mainland Greece, the Italian Apennines and eastern California. Finally, we infer the calibre of sediments entering the hanging-wall basin by integrating measurements of erosion rate across the growing footwall with the variation in surface processes in space and time. Combining this information with the observed structural control of sediment entry points into individual hanging-wall depocentres we develop a greater understanding of facies changes associated with the rift-initiation to rift-climax transition previously recognised in syn-rift stratigraphy.},

Our results provide new constraints on the faulting of oceanic lithosphere at the outer rise, which is important for understanding the transmission of platedriving forces through the subduction system. In all cases, shallow normal-faulting earthquakes are observed at the top of the plate, and are separated in depth from any deeper thrust-faulting earthquakes. No temporal variation associated with large thrust-faulting earthquakes on the subduction interface is seen in the depth extent of each type of faulting at the outer rise. The transition depth from trench-normal extension to compression is found to vary in agreement with models in which deformation is driven by the combination of in-plane stresses and bending stresses, resulting principally from slab pull. Combining the seismologically derived constraints on the thickness of the elastic core of the plate with estimates of the plate curvature, we place upper bounds on the strength of the lithosphere at the outer rise, which is required to be 300 MPa for a constant yield stress model, or governed by an effective coefficient of friction of 0.3.},

  abstract = {Calculating surface topography in geodynamic models is a common numerical problem. Be- sides other approaches, the so-called `sticky air' approach has gained interest as a free-surface proxy at the top boundary. The often used free slip condition is thereby vertically extended by introducing a lowdensity, lowviscosity fluid layer. This allows the air/crust interface to behave in a similar manner to a true free surface.We present here a theoretical analysis that provides the physical conditions under which the sticky air approach is a valid approximation of a true free surface. Two cases are evaluated that characterize the evolution of topography on different timescales: (1) isostatic relaxation of a cosine perturbation and (2) topography changes above a rising plume.We quantitatively compare topographies calculated by six different numerical codes (using finite difference and finite element techniques) using three different topography calculation methods: (i) direct calculation of topography from normal stress, (ii) body-fitting methods allowing for meshing the topography and (iii) Lagrangian tracking of the topography on an Eulerian grid. It is found that the sticky air approach works well as long as the term ({$\eta$}st/{$\eta$}ch)/(hst/L)3 is sufficiently small, where {$\eta$}st and hst are the viscosity and thickness of the sticky air layer, and {$\eta$}ch and L are the characteristic viscosity and length scale of the model, respectively. Spurious lateral fluctuations of topography, as observed in some marker-based sticky air approaches, may effectively be damped by an anisotropic distribution of markers with a higher number of markers per element in the vertical than in the horizontal direction.},

Our initial findings reveal that horizontally forced subduction zone initiation is dominant over the last 100\,Ma, and that most initiation events are proximal to pre-existing subduction zones. The SZI Database is expandable to facilitate access to the most current understanding of subduction zone initiation as research progresses, providing a community platform that establishes a common language to sharpen discussion across the Earth Science community.},

  abstract = {We present a stochastic modelling of erosion--sedimentation processes, based on cellular automata, which mimics the natural variability of climatic events with deterministic transport processes. The numerical procedure calculates the runoff water discharge as a function of the return period of elementary walking elements. This procedure generates water flux distributions at each point of the system, that depends on the local drainage area, and on the walker rainfall, and that are statistically analogous to natural river discharge distributions. It happens that a wide range of non-linear transport processes can be directly simulated in a intuitive way, relating the water flux and the local slope to the sediment transport activity. The present version of the code encompasses the main characteristics of erosion--sedimentation processes, from the simple hillslope diffusive law to the more complex non-linear fluvial transport. To illustrate the versatility of the model to reproduce complex natural dynamics, we calculate several geomorphological instabilities which are crucial in relief dynamics.}

  abstract = {We review the tectonic evolution of the southwest Pacific east of Australia from ca 120 Ma until the present. A key factor that developed early in this interval and played a major role in the subsequent geodynamic history of this region was the calving off from eastern Australia of several elongate microcontinental ribbons, including the Lord Howe Rise and Norfolk -- New Caledonia Ridge. These microcontinental ribbons were isolated from Australia and from each other during a protracted extension episode from ca 120 to 52 Ma, with oceanic crust accretion occurring from 85 to 52 Ma and producing the Tasman Sea and the South Loyalty Basin. Generation of these microcontinental ribbons and intervening basins was assisted by emplacement of a major mantle plume at 100 Ma beneath the southern part of the Lord Howe Rise, which in turn contributed to rapid and efficient eastward trench rollback. A major change in Pacific plate motion at ca 55 Ma initiated east-directed subduction along the recently extinct spreading centre in the South Loyalty Basin, generating boninitic lithosphere along probably more than 1000 km of plate boundary in this region, and growth of the Loyalty-D'Entrecasteaux arc. Continued subduction of South Loyalty Basin crust led to the arrival at about 38 Ma of the 70-60 million years old western volcanic passive margin of the Norfolk Ridge at the trench, and west-directed emplacement of the New Caledonia ophiolite. Lowermost allochthons of this ophiolite are Maastrichtian and Paleocene rift tholeiites derived from the underthrusting passive margin. Higher allochthonous sheets include a poorly exposed boninitic lava slice, which itself was over-ridden by the massive ultramafic sheets that cover large parts of New Caledonia and are derived from the colliding forearc of the Loyalty-D'Entrecasteaux arc. Post-collisional extensional tectonism exhumed the under thrust passive margin, parts of which have blueschist and eclogite facies metamorphic assemblages. Following locking of this subduction zone at 38-34 Ma, subduction jumped east-ward, to form a newwest-dipping subduction zone above which formed the Vitiaz arc, that contained elements which today are located in the Tongan, Fijian, Vanuatu and Solomons arcs. Several episodes of arc splitting fragmented the Vitiaz arc and produced first the South Fiji Basin (31-25 Ma) and later (10 Ma to present) the North Fiji Basin. Collision of the Ontong Java Plateau, a large igneous province, with the Solomons section of the Vitiaz arc resulted in a reversal of subduction polarity, and growth of the Vanuatu arc on clockwise-rotating, older Vitiaz arc and South Fiji Basin crust. Continued rollback of the trench fronting the Tongan arc since 6 Ma has split this arc and produced the Lau Basin-Havre Trough. This southwest Pacific style of crustal growth above a rolling-back slab is applied to the 600-220 Ma tectonic development of the Tasman Fold Belt System in southeastern Australia, and explains key aspects of the geological evolution of eastern Australia. In particular, collision between a plume-triggered 600 Ma volcanic passive margin and a 510-515 Ma boninitic forearc of an intra-oceanic arc had the same relative orientation and geological effects as that which produced New Caledonia. A new subduction system formed probably at least several hundred kilometres east of the collision zone and produced the Macquarie Arc, In which the oldest lavas were erupted ca 480 Ma. Continued slab rollback induced regional extension and the growth of narrow linear troughs in the Macquarie Arc, which persisted until terminal deformation of this fold belt in the late-Middle to Late Devonian. A similar pattern of tectonic development generated the New England Fold Belt between the Late Devonian and Late Triassic. Parts of the New England Fold Belt have been broken from Australia and moved oceanward to locations in New Zealand, and on the Lord Howe Rise and Norfolk - New Caledonia Rise, during the post-120 Ma breakup. Given that the Tasman Fold Belt System grew between 600 and 220 Ma by crustal accretion like the southwest Pacific since 120 Ma, facing the open Pacific Ocean, we question whether the eastern (Australia-Antarctica) part of the Neoproterozoic Rodinian supercontinent was Joined to Laurentia.\${\textbackslash}backslash\$n},

  abstract = {Tectonic displacement contaminates estimates of peak eustatic sea level (and, equivalently, minimum continental ice volumes) determined from the elevation of Quaternary interglacial highstand markers. For sites at which a stratigraphic or geomorphic marker of peak Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5e sea level exists, the standard approach for estimating local tectonic uplift (or subsidence) rates takes the difference between the elevation of the local highstand marker and a reference MIS 5e eustatic value, commonly chosen as {\th}6 m, and divides by the age of the marker. The resulting rate is then applied to correct the elevation of all other local observed sea-level markers for tectonic displacement, including peak highstands of different ages (e.g., MIS 5a, MIS 5c and MIS 11), under the assumption that the tectonic rate remained constant over those periods. This approach introduces two potentially significant errors. First, the peak eustatic value adopted for MIS 5e in most previous studies (i.e., {\th}6 m) is likely incorrect. Second, local peak sea level during MIS 5e is characterized by significant departures from eustasy due to glacial isostatic adjustment in response to both successive glacialeinterglacial cycles and excess polar ice-sheet melt relative to present day values. We use numerical models of glacial isostatic adjustment that incorporate both of these effects to quantify the plausible range of the combined error and show that, even at sites far from melting ice sheets, local peak sea level during MIS 5e may depart from eustasy by 2e4 m, or more. We also demonstrate that the associated error in the estimated tectonic rates can significantly alter previous estimates of peak eustatic sea level during Quaternary highstands, notably those associated with earlier interglacials (e.g., MIS 11).},

  abstract = {The variation of ocean depth with age in the absence of crustal thickening and dynamic support places valuable constraints on the thermal and rheological properties of the lithosphere and asthenosphere. We have attempted to estimate this variation using a global data set of shiptracks, with particular emphasis on young ocean floor. In this respect, this paper extends a previous study published in this journal by the same authors, which concentrated on the older parts of the ocean basins. We find that, prior to 80 Ma, subsidence patterns are reasonably consistent, with gradients of 325 {\textpm} 20 m Ma -1/2 and zero-age depths of 2600 {\textpm} 200 m. There is a strong inverse correlation between zero-age depth and the gradient of depth with the square root of age which is unrelated to local variations in dynamic support. Global depth-age trends to 160 Ma are not significantly different to those for the individual ocean basins. Within corridors of similar basement age, gravity--topography correlations are consistently 30 {\textpm} 5 mGal km-1. Simple isostatic theory and numerical modelling of mantle plumes suggests that, if the minimum depth of convection is defined by the base of the mechanical boundary layer, the admittance should be a function of plate age. The observation that it is not implies that the active convective upwelling beneath young lithosphere ceases at the same depth as it does beneath old oceanic plates. This result is consistent with geochemical modelling of melts near mid-ocean ridges. We have examined the relationship between residual topography and gravity worldwide, and have found that good spatial correlations are restricted to the Atlantic, North Pacific and youngest Indian ocean basins. By contrast, residual topography and gravity are poorly or negatively correlated in the South and young North Pacific Ocean and in the older Indian Ocean. Away from regions of thick crust and flexure, histograms of residual topography and gravity have symmetric distributions about zero. We then use this residual topography to estimate the volume and buoyancy flux of seven major plume swells. In Hawaii, the clear correlation between melt and swell volumes in discrete age corridors is evidence that the horizontal velocity of the hot plume material far downstream from the plume is similar to the plate spreading velocity and that the plume pulses over time. Finally, comparison with seismic tomographic models suggests that the long-wavelength ({$>$}2000 km) residual topographic and gravity anomalies have an origin deeper than 250 km. This result is consistent with observations that the admittance is approximately constant at wavelengths longer than 800 km.},

  abstract = {We reassess the applicability of the thermal plate cooling model to the subsidence of the North Pacific, Atlantic and North Indian Ocean Basins. We use a new numerical plate model in which the thermophysical parameters of the lithosphere vary with temperature according to the results of laboratory experiments, and the ridge temperature structure is consistent with the thickness of the oceanic crust. We first attempt to exclude thickened crust from our data set, and then to exclude swells and downwellings by masking regions of the data that remains that have significant gravity anomalies when there exists a clear regional correlation between intermediate-wavelength gravity and topography. We find that the average variation of depth with age is consistent with conventional half-space models until about 90 Myr. Thereafter, the departure from the half-space cooling curve is more rapid than predicted using simple conductive plate cooling models. The depth-age curves in the Pacific and Atlantic show similar to 250 m of temporary shallowing between the ages of 90-130 Myr, a result consistent with the outcome of experiments on the initiation of small-scale boundary layer convection. The results do not change significantly if the estimated component of the gravity arising from plate cooling is subtracted prior to calculation of the correlation between gravity and topography. A 90-km-thick conductive plate is nevertheless a reasonable model for the average temperature structure of the oldest part of the Pacific ocean lithosphere. In the Pacific, the broad topographic undulations associated with the Line Island Swell, the Hawaiian Swell and surrounding basins have correlated gravity anomalies and an admittance of approximately 30 mGal km(-1) and are likely to result from convective circulation in the upper mantle. In the Northeast Atlantic, the intermediate-wavelength admittance over the Cape Verde swell is similar; in the Northwest Atlantic over the Bermuda Swell it is slightly larger but not as well constrained.},

The results show that the average extrusive volume of individual volcanoes along the seamount chain is 2587 {\textpm} 3078 km3 (1 s), and that volumes generally increase towards the south. An exception, the Britannia Guyot, located in the middle of the seamount chain, is the most voluminous (11,374 km3). Nineteen new 40Ar/39Ar ages, from Wreck to Gascoyne, show that the emplacement of the Tasmantid Seamounts occurred between 33.2 {\textpm} 1.5 and 6.5 {\textpm} 0.6 Ma. A single linear regression applied to the age versus latitude data, assuming volcanism to be caused by plate migration over a stationary hotspot, reveals a plate migration rate of 62 {\textpm} 2 kmMa- 1 (R2 = 0.97; n = 27) between {$\sim$} 33 and 6 Ma. However, the bend in the seamount track, corresponding with the period of largest eruptive volumes, suggests three distinct segments in the Tasmantid age versus latitude data. The northern segment is consistent with a plate migration rate of 75 {\textpm} 10 kmMa- 1 (R2 = 0.88; n = 10) and the southern segment reveals a plate migration rate of 64 {\textpm} 4 kmMa- 1 (R2 = 0.94; n = 17). The period between these two segments, from {$\sim$} 25 to 19 Ma, overlaps with the period of slow migration and change in the direction of the Australian plate derived from the age versus latitude distribution of continental central volcanoes. The new Tasmantid Seamount results support the interpretation that there were changes in the velocity and direction to Australia's northward trajectory, possibly resulting from a series of collisional events.},

  abstract = {The eastern margin of the Australian continent hosts a large number of Cenozoic intraplate volcanoes along a 2000 km long track. Here, we study mafic lavas from the Buckland volcano, Queensland, located in the northern (older) segment of this track, to assess magma generation and differentiation through time. The rocks are aphanitic to microporphyritic basalts, trachy-basalts and basanites. Incompatible element geochemistry together with Sr-Nd-Pb isotope ratios indicate that magmas formed from an enriched mantle I (EMI)-like garnet-bearing source with variable degrees of crustal contamination. Whole rock elemental variations suggest fractionation of olivine, plagioclase, clinopyroxene and/or magnetite. There is no petrographic or geochemical evidence of magma mixing in the studied rocks (e.g., lack of recycled minerals), suggesting a relatively quick ascent from the source to the surface without major storage at shallow levels. 40Ar/39Ar geochronology reveals two stages of volcanism: 30.3 {\textpm} 0.1 Ma and 27.4 {\textpm} 0.2 Ma. The Old Buckland (30.3 {\textpm} 0.1 Ma) melts have negative K anomalies, and incompatible element ratios suggest the occurrence of residual hydrous minerals in a metasomatised mantle source. We therefore infer that at the onset of volcanism, deep-mantle-derived magmas interacted with metasomatised sub-continental lithospheric mantle (SCLM). Major and trace element data, clinopyroxene thermobarometry and thermodynamic modelling indicate magma evolution by assimilation and fractional crystallisation (AFC) during ascent through the crust. Following a hiatus in volcanic activity of {$\sim$}2.5 Ma, eruption of Young Buckland (27.4 {\textpm} 0.2 Ma) lavas marked a shift towards more alkaline compositions. Trace element compositions indicate lower degrees of partial melting and a lack of interaction with metasomatic components. Young Buckland lavas become progressively more SiO2-saturated up stratigraphy, suggesting an increase in the degree of partial melting with time. Young Buckland lavas also have more radiogenic 87Sr/86Sr and 207Pb/204Pb ratios and less radiogenic 143Nd/144Nd ratios up stratigraphy. These isotopic variations, together with coupled increases in Pb and K and decreases in Ce/Pb (27.22 to 11.09) and Nb/U (68.30 to 29.96), suggest that crustal contamination also increased with time. By placing absolute age and stratigraphic constraints on the Buckland lavas, we have been able to ascertain differentiation signatures imposed on mantle-derived melts during ascent through the continental lithosphere over 3 Ma. Our study provides new constraints on magma generation and differentiation in continental intraplate volcanic systems.},

  abstract = {Despite its importance, the temporal and spatial evolution of continental dynamic topography is poorly known. Australia's isolation from active plate boundaries and its rapid northward motion within a hot spot reference frame make it a useful place to investigate the interplay between mantle convection, topography, and drainage. Offshore, dynamic topography is relatively well constrained and can be accounted for by Australia's translation over the mantle's convective circulation. To build a database of onshore constraints, we have analyzed an inventory of longitudinal river profiles, which is sensitive to uplift rate history. Using independently constrained erosional parameters, we determine uplift rates by minimizing the misfit between observed and calculated river profiles. Resultant fits are excellent and calculated uplift histories match independent geologic constraints. We infer that western and central Australia underwent regional uplift during the last 50 Myr and that the Eastern Highlands have been uplifted in two stages. The first stage from 120 to 80 Ma, coincided with rifting along the eastern margin and its existence is supported by thermochronological measurements. A second stage occurred at 80--10 Ma, formed the Great Escarpment, and coincided with Cenozoic volcanism. The relationship between topography, gravity anomalies, and shear wave tomographic models suggest that regional elevation is supported by temperature anomalies within the lithosphere's thermal boundary layer. Morphology and stratigraphy of the Eastern Highlands imply that these anomalies have been coupled to the base of the plate during Australia's northward motion over the last 70 Myr.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY             We present a 2-D thermomechanical computational framework for simulating earthquake sequences in a non-linear visco-elasto-plastic compressible medium. The method is developed for a plane-strain problem and incorporates an invariant formulation of the classical rate- and state-dependent friction law and an adaptive time-stepping, which allows the time step to vary by many orders of magnitude during a simulation. Long-term tectonic convergence is imposed by displacing a boundary at a constant rate, whereas temperature-dependent viscosity is solved using a rapidly converging Newton--Raphson scheme. The 2-D volume is discretized using finite differences on a fully staggered grid and marker-in-cell techniques. An adaptive free-surface approximation is used to modulate the air viscosity with the time step, which allows stresses to vanish on the free surface during the propagation of fast slipping events. We present a set of increasingly complex models in which we investigate how inertia, radiation damping, thermally activated non-linear rheology and off-megathrust splay-fault events affect sequences of seismic and aseismic slip on a simplified subduction megathrust. The new method provides a unique computational framework to analyse earthquake sequences and to connect forearc deformation with the dynamic properties of the megathrust, thus providing a physical link between observations spanning from slow interseismic strain accumulation to localized coseismic slip of individual earthquakes and post-seismic viscoelastic relaxation.},

Renewed interest in the structure of the Sydney Basin, driven primarily by sequestration studies, geothermal studies and coal seam gas exploration, has highlighted the need for a model of deep basin geology, structure and thermal state. Here, we combine gravity modelling, seismic reflection surveys, borehole drilling results and other relevant information to develop a deep 3D geological model of the Sydney Basin. The structure of the Sydney Basin is characteristic of a typical intracontinental rift basin, with a deep north--south orientated channel in the Lachlan Fold Belt basement, filled with up to 4 km of rift volcanics, and overlain with Permo-Triassic sediments up to 4 km thick. The deep regional architecture presented in this study will form the framework for more detailed geological, hydrological and geothermal model},

  abstract = {Carbon geochemistry of mantle-derived samples suggests that the fluxes and reservoir sizes associated with deep cycle are in the order of 1012-13gC/yr and 1022-23g C, respectively. This deep cycle is responsible for the billion year-scale evolution of the terrestrial carbon reservoirs. The petrology of deep storage modulates the long-term evolution and distribution of terrestrial carbon. Unlike water, which in most of the Earth's mantle is held in nominally anhydrous silicates, carbon is stored in accessory phases. The accessory phase of interest, with increasing depth, typically changes from fluids/melts{$\rightarrow$}calcite/dolomite{$\rightarrow$}magnesite{$\rightarrow$}diamond/Fe-rich alloy/Fe-metal carbide, assuming that the mass balance and oxidation state are buffered solely by silicates. If, however, carbon is sufficiently abundant, it may reside as carbonate even in the deep mantle. If Earth's deep mantle is Fe-metal saturated, carbon storage in metal alloy and as metal carbide cannot be avoided for depleted and enriched domains, respectively. Carbon ingassing to the interior is aided by modern subduction of the carbonated oceanic lithosphere, whereas outgassing from the mantle is controlled by decompression melting of carbonated mantle. Carbonated melting at {\textbackslash}textgreater300km depth or redox melting of diamond-bearing or metal-bearing mantle at somewhat shallower depth generates carbonatitic and carbonated silicate melts and are the chief agents for liberating carbon from the solid Earth to the exosphere. Petrology allows net ingassing of carbon into the mantle in the modern Earth, but in the hotter subduction zones that prevailed during the Hadean, Archean, and Paleoproterozoic, carbonate likely was released at shallow depths and may have returned to the exosphere. Inefficient ingassing, along with efficient outgassing, may have kept the ancient mantle carbon-poor. The influence of carbon on deep Earth dynamics is through inducing melting and mobilization of structurally bound mineral water. Extraction of carbonated melt on one hand can dehydrate the mantle and enhance viscosity; the presence of trace carbonated melt on other may generate seismic low-velocity zones and amplify attenuation. {\copyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

The approach centers upon a finite element discretization on unstructured simplex meshes, which represent complex geometries in a straightforward manner. Throughout a simulation, the mesh is dynamically adapted to optimize the representation of evolving solution structures. The adaptive algorithm makes use of anisotropic measures of solution complexity, to vary resolution and allow long, thin elements to align with features such as boundary layers. The modeling framework presented differs from the majority of current mantle convection codes, which are typically based upon fixed structured grids. This necessitates a thorough and detailed validation, which is a focus of this paper. Benchmark comparisons are undertaken with a range of two- and three-dimensional, isoviscous and variable viscosity cases. In addition, model predictions are compared to experimental results. Such comparisons highlight not only the robustness and accuracy of Fluidity but also the advantages of anisotropic adaptive unstructured meshes, significantly reducing computational requirements when compared to a fixed mesh simulation.},

Second, in other regions of data coverage the estimate is based on data measurements. At the map resolution, these two categories (young ocean, data covered) cover 65\% of Earth's surface. Third, for all other regions the estimate is based on the assumption that there is a correlation between heat flow and geology. This assumption is assessed and the correlation is found to provide a minor improvement over assuming that heat flow would be represented by the global average. The map is made available digitally.

  abstract = {Two large low-shear-velocity provinces (LLSVPs) in the deep mantle beneath Africa and the Pacific are generally interpreted as hot but chemically dense `piles', which have remained isolated from mantle circulation for several hundred million years. This interpretation largely hinges on four seismic observations: (i) their shear wave velocity anomalies are considered too large for purely thermal structures; (ii) shear wave velocity gradients at their edges are sharp; (iii) their shear to compressional wave-speed anomaly ratios are high; and (iv) their shear and bulk-sound velocity anomalies appear to be anti-correlated. However, using compressible global mantle circulation models driven by 300 Myr of plate motion history and thermodynamic methods for converting from physical to seismic structure, we show that observed lower mantle shear wave velocity anomalies do not require, and are most likely incompatible with, large-scale chemical `piles'. A prescribed core-mantle-boundary temperature of 4000 K, which is consistent with current estimates, combined with anelastic seismic sensitivity to temperature, ensures that purely thermal LLSVPs, strongly focussed beneath Africa and the Pacific by subduction history, can reconcile observed shear wave velocity anomalies and gradients. By contrast, shear wave velocity anomalies from models that include dense chemical `piles' at the base of Earth's mantle, where `piles' correspond to only 3\% of the mantle's volume, are substantially stronger than the tomographic model S40RTS, even after accounting for limited tomographic resolution. Our results also suggest that in the presence of post-perovskite, elevated ratios between shear and compressional wavespeed anomalies and the correlation between shear and bulk-sound velocity anomalies cannot be used to discriminate between thermal and compositional heterogeneity at depth: in all calculations, an anticorrelation only occurs within the post-perovskite stability field. Taken together, this implies that although there must be considerable chemical heterogeneity within Earth's mantle, large, coherent `piles' are not required to reconcile the seismic observations examined here. Indeed, our results suggest that if chemical heterogeneity is present in these regions, its dynamical and seismic significance is far less than has previously been inferred.},

  abstract = {It has been proposed that volcanic hotspots and the reconstructed eruption sites of large igneous provinces (LIPs) are preferentially located above the margins of two deep mantle large low shear-wave velocity provinces (LLSVPs), beneath the African continent and the Pacific Ocean. This spatial correlation has been interpreted to imply that LLSVPs represent long-lived, dense, stable thermo-chemical piles, which preferentially trigger mantle plumes at their edges and exert a strong influence on lower-mantle dynamics. Here, we re-analyse this spatial correlation, demonstrating that it is not global: it is strong for the African LLSVP, but weak for the Pacific. Moreover, Monte Carlo based statistical analyses indicate that the observed distribution of African and Pacific hotspots/reconstructed LIPs is consistent with the hypothesis that they are drawn from a sample that is uniformly distributed across the entire areal extent of each LLSVP: the stronger spatial correlation with the margin of the African LLSVP is expected as a simple consequence of its elongated geometry, where more than 75\% of the LLSVP interior lies within 10{$^\circ$} of its margin. Our results imply that the geographical distribution of hotspots and reconstructed LIPs does not indicate the extent to which chemical heterogeneity influences lower-mantle dynamics.},

  abstract = {Crustal receiver functions have been calculated for a network of 51 three-component broadband seismometers distributed across the British Isles and NW Europe. Over 3200 receiver functions were assembled for 1055 events. For each station, preliminary estimates of crustal thickness and Vp/Vs ratio were obtained from H-{$\kappa$} plots. Stacked receiver functions were then inverted to determine shear wave velocity as a function of depth. Each result was checked by guided forward modelling and by Monte Carlo error analysis. In this way, the robustness of our final calculated velocity profiles was carefully tested. A set of depth migrated profiles was also constructed using an average of 50 events for each station over a range of backazimuths. These profiles agree well with legacy wide-angle crustal models. Our results show that crustal thickness varies between 24 and 36 km across the British Isles. Thicker crust is found beneath north Wales and beneath central Scotland. Thinner crust occurs beneath northwest Scotland and northwest Ireland. By combining our database with the results of controlled source, wide-angle experiments and with depth-converted reflection profiles, we have produced a detailed crustal thickness map for a region encompassing the British Isles. Our synthesis of crustal thickness and structure has important implications for the tectonic and magmatic histories of this region. Complex Moho structure with lower crustal P-wave velocities of {\textbackslash}textgreater7 km s-1 occurs beneath regions of Cenozoic magmatism, which may be consistent with magmatic underplating. Thin crust beneath northern Britain suggests that present-day long wavelength topography is maintained by regional dynamic support, originating beneath the lithospheric plate.},

  abstract = {The dynamics of Earth's inner core depends critically on whether it is stably stratified or unstably stratified. We propose here a general analysis of the thermal evolution of the inner core. Whether the geotherm in the inner core is superadiabatic or not depends on the inner core solidification rate, on the thermal diffusivity of iron at inner core conditions, and on the ratio of the Clapeyron slope to the adiabatic gradient in the inner core. The temperature field within the inner core can be destabilizing---and could drive convection---if the growth of the inner core is fast enough. The effect of radiogenic heating is probably small, and, perhaps surprisingly, can even stabilize the inner core against convection. The uncertainties are such that it is not possible at present to conclude about the likelihood of thermal convection in the inner core, but recent estimates of the Core--Mantle Boundary (CMB) heat flux and inner core conductivity favour convection. Thermal convection is more likely early in the inner core history, a consequence of the secular decrease in cooling rate of the core. In addition, solidification-induced partitioning of the light elements may induce a stable density stratification within the inner core.},

The rocks are relatively primitive (6.9-9.1\% MgO), incompatible trace element-enriched alkali basalts with (super 87) Sr/ (super 86) Sr = 0.70398-0.70415 and (super 143) Nd/ (super 144) Nd = 0.51280-0.51271. Trace element modelling suggests that they reflect 3-6\% partial melting in the presence of 2-8\% residual garnet. Trends towards low K/K (super *) are accompanied by decreasing (super 87) Sr/ (super 86) Sr and provide evidence for the involvement of hydrous phases during melting. (super 230) Th excesses of 12-57\% cannot be simulated by batch melting of the lithosphere and instead require dynamic melting models. It is argued that the distinction between continental basalts bearing significant U-Th disequilibria and those in secular equilibrium reflects dynamic melting in upwelling asthenosphere, rather than static batch melting within the lithosphere or the presence or absence of residual garnet. Upwelling rates are estimated at approximately 1.5 cm/yr. A subdued, localised topographic uplift associated with the magmatism suggests that any upwelling is more likely associated with a secondary mode localised to the upper mantle, rather than a broad zone of deeply-sourced (plume) upwelling. Upper mantle, "edge-driven" convection is consistent with seismic tomographic and anisotropy studies that imply rapid differential motion of variable thickness Australian lithosphere and the underlying asthenosphere. In this scenario, melting is linked to a significant contribution from hydrous mantle that is envisaged as resulting either from convective entrainment of lithosphere along the trailing edge of a lithospheric keel, or inherited variability in the asthenosphere.},

By applying pseudospectral and boundary element methods to synthesize compressional waves interacting with the ICB, these effects are predicted and compared with waveform observations in pre-critical, critical, post-critical, and diffraction ranges of the PKiKP wave reflected from the ICB. These data sample overlapping regions of the inner core beneath the circumPacific belt and the Eurasian, North American, and Australian continents, but exclude large areas beneath the Pacific and Indian Oceans and the poles. In the pre-critical range, PKiKP waveforms require an upper bound of 2 km at 1--20 km wavelength for any ICB topography. Higher topography sharply reduces PKiKP amplitude and produces time-extended coda not observed in PKiKP waveforms. The existence of topography of this scale smooths over minima and zeros in the pre-critical ICB reflection coefficient predicted from standard earth models. In the range surrounding critical incidence (108--130 ), this upper bound of topography does not strongly affect the amplitude and waveform behavior of PKIKP + PKiKP at 1.5 Hz, which is relatively insensitive to 10--20 km wavelength topography height approaching 5 km. These data, however, have a strong overlap in the regions of the ICB sampled by pre-critical PKiKP that require a 2 km upper bound to topography height. In the diffracted range ({$>$}152{$^\circ$}), topography as high as 5 km attenuates the peak amplitudes of PKIKP and PKPCdiff by similar amounts, leaving the PKPCdiff/PKIKP amplitude ratio unchanged from that predicted by a smooth ICB. The observed decay of PKPCdiff into the inner core shadow and the PKIKP-PKPCdiff differential travel time are consistent with a flattening of the outer core P velocity gradient near the ICB and iron enrichment at the bottom of the outer core.},

  abstract = {Incompressibility is established for three- and two-dimensional deformations of an anisotropic linearly elastic material, as conditions to be satis ed by the elastic compliances. These conditions make it straightforward to derive results for incompressible materials from those established for compressible materials. As an illustration, the explicit secular equation is obtained for surface waves in incompressible monoclinic materials with the symmetry plane at x3 = 0. This equation also covers the case of incompressible orthotropic materials. The displacements and stresses for surface waves are often expressed in terms of the elastic sti nesses, which can be unbounded in the incompressible limit. An alternative formalism in terms of the elastic compliances presented recently by Ting (Proc. R. Soc. London (2002), in press) is employed so that surface wave solutions in the incompressible limit can be obtained. A di erent formalism, also by Ting (Proc. R. Soc. London A 455 (1999) 69), is employed to study the solutions to two-dimensional elastostatic problems. In the special case of incompressible monoclinic materials with the symmetry plane at x3 = 0, one of the three Barnett--Lothe tensors S vanishes while the other two tensors H and L are the inverse of each other. Moreover, H and L are diagonal with the  rst two diagonal elements being identical. Many interesting physical phenomena can be deduced using this property. For instance, there is no interpenetration of the interface crack surfaces in an incompressible bimaterial. When only the inplane deformation is considered, the image force due to a line dislocation in a half-space or in a bimaterial depends on the magnitude, not on the direction, of the Burgers vector. ? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The top 60--80 km of the inner core is isotropic; evidence for an innermost inner core is less compelling. The anisotropy is most likely due to alignment of hcp (hexagonal close-packed) iron crystals, aligned either during solidification or by deformation afterward. The existence of hemispherical variations used to be controversial, but there is now strong evidence from both seismic body wave and normal mode observations, showing stronger anisotropy, less attenuation, and a lower isotropic velocity in the western hemisphere. Two mechanisms have been proposed to explain the hemispherical pattern: either (a) inner core translation, wherein one hemisphere is melting and the other is solidifying, or (b) thermochemical convection in the outer core, leading to different solidification conditions at the inner core boundary. Neither is (yet) able to explain all seismically observed features, and a combination of different mechanisms is probably required.},

  abstract = {It has been 25 years since Sulsky and her co-workers developed the first version of the material point method (MPM): a quasi particle method to solve continuum mechanics problems. In the MPM, the continua are discretized by Lagrangian particles moving over a fixed Eulerian background grid. As a result, large deformation and contact can be treated effortlessly. Since then, many improved instances of the MPM have been developed and the MPM has found applications in many fields from geoengineering to movie industry. As the MPM has now been matured and a large body of literature on it exists, it is a good time to ponder and reflect on the developments of the method to date. To this end, this manuscript provides a concise introduction to the MPM, covering theory, implementation and applications. All the algorithms required to have a working MPM implementation for the simulations of solids, fluids and their interactions are provided. We have coded these algorithms in in-house open source programs and used them to study the performance of different MPM variants for large deformation solid mechanics problems. These problems exhibit large plastic deformation, fractures and contacts. Convergence of different MPMs (CPDI, GIMP, B-splines, Total Lagrangian MPM, improved MPMs) are studied. Furthermore, MPM formulations for fluids/gases and heat conduction are also covered. Potential areas for improvement on the method have been identified. The paper is the first review of the MPM and presents a state-of-the-art of the current MPM literature covering 339 references.},

  abstract = {The West Antarctic Ice Sheet overlies the West Antarctic Rift System about which, due to the comprehensive ice cover, we have only limited and sporadic knowledge of volcanic activity and its extent. Improving our understanding of subglacial volcanic activity across the province is important both for helping to constrain how volcanism and rifting may have influenced ice-sheet growth and decay over previous glacial cycles, and in light of concerns over whether enhanced geothermal heat fluxes and subglacial melting may contribute to instability of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. Here, we use ice-sheet bed-elevation data to locate individual conical edifices protruding upwards into the ice across West Antarctica, and we propose that these edifices represent subglacial volcanoes.We used aeromagnetic, aerogravity, satellite imagery and databases of confirmed volcanoes to support this interpretation. The overall result presented here constitutes a first inventory of West Antarctica's subglacial volcanism. We identified 138 volcanoes, 91 of which have not previously been identified, and which are widely distributed throughout the deep basins of West Antarctica, but are especially concentrated and orientated along the {\textbackslash}textgreater 3000 km central axis of the West Antarctic Rift System.}

  abstract = {This paper is an essay on the rationalism and difficulties of the geological corollaries of plate tectonics, with illustrations particularly from the geological history of the British Isles. There is special emphasis on the mechanics of continental lithosphere in extension, when basins are formed and in convergence whereby continental lithosphere thinned in extension is shortened and restacked to form orogenic belts. An upper lithosphere stress-concentrating elastic lid suffers extremely complex inhomogeneous deformations above a simpler, viscoelastic lower lithosphere whose deformation drives strain and displacement in the elastic lid. The very nature of plate tectonics as relative motion among a multi-plate mosaic of plates provides a rational semi-quantitative framework for large-scale geological complexity in space and time. The Caledonian and Hercynian history of the British Isles may be explained semi-quantitatively in terms of plate boundary evolution but it is not possible to define unequivocal solutions. The rationalism of plate tectonics is exhibited on a smaller, more direct field-scale by many of the complexities of ophiolite complexes, such as Ballantrae (Scotland), that can be explained as the effects of the evolution of ridge/ridge transforms and by diachronous deformation and sedimentation in subduction accretion prisms such as the Southern Uplands. Deformational and sedimentary patterns in NW Europe from Triassic times to the present day resulted from a complex interaction of extensional events related to diachronous Atlantic opening and compressional events related to sequential Alpine shortening phases. Those widespread events are typical of intracontinental plate boundary systems and create great difficulties for the geologist wishing to decipher relative plate motion from geological sequences, because huge areas, much larger than the British Isles, must be analysed and synthesized before much sense can be extracted. Further difficulties arise from the palinspastic and preservation problems of convergent boundaries; orogenic shortening telescopes and partially subducts facies belts. Most orogenic belts were assembled as a collage of displaced and rotated terrain elements that were subsequently flattened, elongated and straightened to an apparent but deceiving simplicity. Therefore, while plate tectonics provides a rational geological framework against which, for example, British basin evolution can be tested and explained, we cannot yet use the geological effects of plate boundary evolution to reconstruct relative plate motion quantitatively.},

  abstract = {The Kaapvaal craton in southern Africa and the Pilbara craton of northwestern Australia are the largest regions on Earth to have retained relatively pristine mid-Archaean rocks (3.0-4.0 Ga). The Kaapvaal craton covers about 1.2X10 (super 6) km (super 2) , and varies in lithospheric thickness between 170 and 350 km. At surface, the craton can be subdivided into a number of Archaean sub-domains; some of the subdomains are also well defined at depth, and local variations in tomography of the lithosphere correspond closely with subdomain boundaries at surface. The Archaean history of the Kaapvaal craton spans about 1 Gyr and can be conveniently subdivided into two periods, each of about the same length as the Phanerozoic. The first period, from circa 3.7-3.1 Ga, records the initial separation of the cratonic lithosphere from the asthenosphere, terminating with a major pulse of accretion tectonics between 3.2 and 3.1 Ga, which includes the formation of "paired metamorphic belts". This period of continental growth can be compared to plate tectonic processes occurring in modern-day oceanic basins. However, the difference is that in the mid-Archaean, these oceanic processes appear to have occurred in shallower water depths than the modern ocean basins. The second period, from circa 3.1-2.6 Ga, records intra-continental and continental-edge processes: continental growth during this period occurred predominantly through a combination of tectonic accretion of crustal fragments and subduction-related igneous processes, in much the same way as has been documented along the margins of the Pacific and Tethys oceans since the Mesozoic. The intra-oceanic processes resulted in small, but deep-rooted continental nucleii; the first separation of this early continental lithosphere could only have occurred when the mean elevation of mid-oceanic-ridges sank below sea-level. Substantial recycling of continental lithosphere into the mantle must have occurred during this period of Earth history. During the second period, at least two large continental nucleii amalgamated during collisional processes which, together with internal chemical differentiation processes, created the first stable continental landmass. This landmass, which is known to have been substantially bigger than its present outline, may have been part of the Earth's first supercontinent. The oldest known subdomains of the craton include the oceanic-like rocks of the Barberton greenstone belt. The comagmatic mafic-ultramafic rocks (3.48-3.49 Ga) of this belt represent a remnant of very early oceanic-like lithosphere (known as the Jamestown Ophiolite Complex), which was obducted, approximately 45 Ma after its formation, onto a volcanic arc-like terrain by processes similar to those which have emplaced modern ophiolites at convergent margins of Phanerozoic continents. The early metamorphic history, metamorphic mineralogy, oxygen isotope profiles and degree of hydration of the 3.49 Ga Jamestown Ophiolite Complex are similar to present day subseafloor hydrothermal systems. The ratio of Delta Mg to Delta Si for hydrothermally altered igneous rocks, both present day and Archaean, are remarkably uniform at -5(+ or -0.9) and the same as that of hydrothermal fluids venting on the present-day East Pacific Rise. This observation suggests that the process of Mg exchange for Si in hydrothermal systems was commonplace throughout Earth's history. The chemistry of vent fluids and hydrothermally altered igneous rocks was combined with an inventory of (super 3) He in the mantle to model Earth's total hydrothermal flux. An Archaean flux (at 3.5 Ga) of about 10 times present day was accompanied by a correspondingly greater abundance of Mg(OH), SiO (sub 2) , carbonate and Fe-Mn metasomatic rock types as well as massive sulphides. Assuming a constant column of seawater since the Archaean, the average residence time of seawater in the oceanic crust was 1.65-8.90X10 (super 5) years in the Archaean. Assuming that (super 3) He and heat are transported from the mantle in silicate melts in uniform proportions, the model stipulates that accretion of oceanic crust decreased from about 3.43-6.5X10 (super 17) g/yr to a present-day rate of 0.52-0.8X10 (super 17) g/yr, with a drop in heat flow from 1.4-2.6X10 (super 20) cal/yr to 2.1-3.2X10 (super 19) cal/year. The total amounts of SiO (sub 2) and Fe mobilised in marine hydrothermal systems since 3.5 Ga is less than their masses in the present exosphere reservoirs (crust, hydrosphere, atmosphere). The total amounts of Mg, K, CO (sub 2) , Ca and Mn are greater than their respective masses in exosphere reservoirs; therefore, they must have been recycled into mantle. The total mass of recycled hydrothermal components is small compared to the mass of the mantle. The flux of volatiles in hydrothermal systems is large compared to their volume in the atmosphere suggesting that the CO (sub 2) and O (sub 2) budgets of the atmosphere have been influenced by hydrothermal processes, especially in the Archaean.},

  abstract = {Global sea level and the pattern of marine inundation on the Australian continent are inconsistent. We quantify this inconsistency and show that it is partly due to a long wavelength, anomalous, downward tilting of the continent to the northeast by 300 m since the Eocene. This downward tilting occurred as Australia approached the subduction systems in South East Asia and is recorded by the progressive inundation of the northern margin of Australia. From the Oligocene to the Pliocene, the long wavelength trend of anomalous topography shows that the southern margin of Australia is characterized by relative subsidence.We quantify the anomalous topography of the Australian continent by computing the displacement needed to reconcile the interpreted pattern of marine incursion with a predicted topography in the presence of global sea level variations. On the southern margin, longwavelength subsidencewas augmented by at least 250m of shorter wavelength anomalous subsidence, consistent with the passage of the southern continental margin over a north--south elongated, 500 km wide, topographic anomaly approximately fixed with respect to the mantle. The present day reconstructed position of this depth anomaly is aligned with the Australian Antarctic Discordance and is consistent with the predicted passage of the Australian continent over a previously subducted slab. Both the long-wavelength continental tilting and smaller-scale paleo-topographic anomaly on the southern Australian margin may have been caused by subduction-generated dynamic topography. These new constraints on continental vertical motion are consistent with the hypothesis that mantle convection induced topography is of the same order of magnitude as global sea level change.}

  abstract = {An unconformity is present close to the Miocene-Pliocene boundary in the onshore and nearshore portions of the Otway, Port Phillip-Torquay, and Gippsland basins of southeast Australia. The unconformity is angular (generally {\textbackslash}textless 1-5\{degrees\} angularity), with the underlying Miocene units having been deformed (gentle folding and reverse faulting) and eroded prior to deposition of the Pliocene succession. The unconformity also marks a change from Oligocene-Miocene deposition of cool-water carbonate sediments and brown coal-bearing successions to the accumulation of more siliciclastic-rich sediments in Pliocene time. The Miocene-Pliocene boundary therefore represents an interval of significant regional uplift in the southeast Australian basins. The amount of section removed is greatest around the Otway and Strzelecki ranges in Victoria, where up to a kilometer of section may have been removed. In most onshore sections of the Victorian basins hundreds of meters of section have been eroded. In distal offshore locations the boundary becomes conformable. The timing of uplift and erosion is best constrained in the Otway and Port Phillip basins, where late Miocene (N16 [{$\sim$}] 10 Ma) sediments underlie the unconformity and earliest Pliocene ([{$\sim$}] 5 Ma) sediments overlie it. This timing coincides with a change in the dynamics of the Australian plate, beginning at around 12 Ma. Southeast Australia is currently under a NW-SE compressional regime, and this has probably persisted since the late Miocene. In the basins (as opposed to the basement-dominated highland areas), the late Miocene uplift event is more significant than later Pliocene-Recent uplift.},

This extends to current debates regarding the age and position of the Tasman Line in Gondwana--Rodinia reconstructions. We present constraints, from mapping, geochemistry and geophysics, on the interpretation of gravity and magnetic lineaments attributed to the Tasman Line in New South Wales, South Australia, Victoria and Tasmania. These pieces of evidence suggest a protracted and complex latest Neoproterozoic to Carboniferous geological history that produces a variety of geophysical responses, rather than a simple `Line'. We also find no evidence of Rodinian breakup age activity responsible for any of the anomalies. In light of these findings, our preference is that the Tasman Line concept be abandoned as misleading, especially with regard to models of Rodinia--Gondwana breakup, which must have occurred elsewhere, possibly well to the east. Instead, the rocks preserved in the westernmost part of the Tasmanides are consistent with previously proposed `Southwest Pacific'-style models for Neoproterozoic continental breakup, margin formation and reaccretion of continental fragments in the Early Palaeozoic.},

Although all mantle plume (ocean island) basalts seem to contain more water than mid-ocean-ridge basalts, we demonstrate that basalts associated with mantle plume components containing subducted lithosphere---`enriched-mantle' or `EM-type' basalts---contain less water than those associated with a common mantle source. We interpret this depletion as indicating that water is extracted from the lithosphere during the subduction process, with greater than 92 per cent efficiency.},

  abstract = {The most common model used for representing the evolution with age of the oceanic lithosphere is the 'plate model' where the temperature is set at a fixed depth, called the base of the plate. This 'base of the plate' has no physical meaning but this model provides a mathematical substitute for a system where small-scale convection occurs through instabilities growing at the base of the cooling lithosphere and becomes effective only below old ocean. Another possible view is that convection provides heat at the base of the lithosphere whatever the age of the overlying plate. This last process can be modeled by a Constant Heat flow Applied on the Bottom Lithospheric ISotherm (CHABLIS model). A good fit to the observables (bathymetry and geoid as function of age, and old age heat-flow) can be obtained both for plate and CHABLIS models in spite of an experimentally determined thermal expansion coefficient much larger than assumed in previous plate models. These models have important consequences for several geodynamic processes. The plate, at an age of 100 Ma is only 80 km thick for both models: melting above a hot-spot can then occur in the garnet-spinel transition field without much plate thinning. In the plate model the subsidence is stopped at an age of about 80 Ma while, according to the CHABLIS model, several hundred meters of subsidence are expected after 100 Ma. Thus the two models predict quite a different long-term pattern of subsidence in the sedimentary basins. Finally, in the CHABLIS model, the global cooling of the mantle coming from cold material eroded by secondary convection at the base of the plates is considerably larger than in plate models: it amounts to 40\%, the remaining 60\% being due to the subduction process.},

It is shown in this paper that this approximation, based on local expansion of H, can lead to large deviations from the exact values whenever the truncation of L after the second term of the expansion is not sufficient. Furthermore, a method for continuously monitoring the validity of this approximation is proposed, and an alternative procedure is examined for the computation of V??\{symbol\}, whenever the usual estimation based on the hessian matrix cannot be used. ?? 1991.}

  abstract = {Studies of lower crustal xenoliths in alkaline volcanics of Europe have revealed that a wide range of rock types exists in the lower crust. These range from eclogites, mafic garnet-bearing and garnet-free granulites, through felsic granulites to high-grade metasediments. Xenolith suites, and by inference the lower crust, are very variable in chemistry and mineralogy. Estimates of lower crustal composition vary according to the proportions of different rock types included in a xenolith suite, from basic ({\textbackslash}textless 50 wt. \% SiO2) to intermediate ({$\approx$} 55 wt. \% SiO2). Ages within the lower crust are very poorly constrained, but zircons from crustal xenoliths are often younger than the oldest rocks exposed at the surface. This suggests that much of the mafic lower crust has been added to the base of the pre-existing crust by processes of intrusion and underplating. Such additions to the crust have probably occurred during periods of subduction, rifting and orogenic collapse. Evidence from radiogenic and stable isotopes suggests that extensive contamination of mafic magmas by the pre-existing crust has occurred. Seismic velocity constraints indicate that in some parts of Europe, e.g. Germany, mafic granulites are confined to the base of the crust, but in other regions (northwest Scotland, Hungary) they may occupy much of the lower crust. In the northern part of the Baltic shield (Kola) the thick crust contains variably retrogressed and metasomatized eclogites at depths between 30 and 48 km. {\copyright} 1993.},

Orientation of planar anisotropy (bedding or cross-bedding) with respect to principal stresses has little influence on the fracture strength. The Donath orientation effect depends on rock type. Strong dependence of fracture strength on porosity is of the form y=axb (where y equals stress difference at failure, x equals porosity, and a {\textbackslash}textgreater 0 {\textbackslash}textgreater b; in our samples, values for a ranged between 16 and 25, kb, and b between -0.8 and -1.0). Through- going shear fractures result from coalescence of grain boundary cracks, extension fractures within grains, and void space. Rocks with low porosity develop through-going shears only after many grains are extension fractured. The functional relationship between porosity and fracture strength derives from the lower energy required for propagating cracks to use void space rather than forming extension fractures.}

In this study, we confirm the existence of a change in the shear velocity spectrum around 1000 km depth based on a new shear velocity tomographic model of the Earth's mantle, SEISGLOB2. This model is based on Rayleigh surface wave phase velocities, self- and crosscoupling structure coefficients of spheroidal normal modes and body wave traveltimes which are, for the first time, combined in a tomographic inversion. SEISGLOB2 is developed up to spherical harmonic degree 40 and in 21 radial spline functions. The spectrum of SEISGLOB2 is the flattest (i.e. richest in 'short' wavelengths corresponding to spherical harmonic degrees greater than 10) around 1000 km depth and this flattening occurs between 670 and 1500 km depth. We also confirmvarious changes in the continuity of slabs and mantle plumes all around 1000 km depth where we also observed the upper boundary of Large Low Shear Velocity Provinces. The existence of a flatter spectrum, richer in short-wavelength heterogeneities, in a region of the mid-mantle can have great impacts on our understanding of the mantle dynamics and should thus be better understood in the future. Although a viscosity increase, a phase change or a compositional change can all concur to induce this change of pattern, its precise origin is still very uncertain.},

  abstract = {Deformations of the colder regions of the lithosphere mainly occur in the frictional regime. In geodynamic models, frictional plastic deformations are often highly localized (shear bands) and are used as proxies for faults. However, capturing the generation and evolution of shear bands in geodynamic models is troublesome. Indeed, mesh dependency and lack of convergence affect, to some extent, the results of geodynamic models. Here we extend the most common plasticity implementation used in geodynamic codes (effective viscosity approach [EVA]) to include the combined effects of elastic compressibility, plastic dilatancy, strain softening, and viscoplasticity. The latter acts as a regularization that cures most of the known issues of geodynamic models related to frictional plasticity. Using regularized models based on the M2Di MATLAB routines, we show that volumetric elasto-plastic deformations can significantly impact crustal-scale shear banding. We also show that the artificial overstress caused by viscoplasticity can be mitigated by employing power-law models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that plasticity algorithms common in geodynamics (based on the EVA) can be as accurate as those obtained with algorithms typically used in engineering (return mapping with a consistent tangent operator). Finally, we show examples of long-term tectonic deformations using the state-of-the art geodynamic code MDoodz. They indicate that viscoplastic regularization can be used efficiently to obtain reliable simulations in geodynamics.},

The diffusivity of all the rocks showed a positive linear dependence on inverse temperatu re and, excluding the East Bull Lake gabbro, showed a linear dependence on quartz content. (Quartz content varied from 0 to 31\% by volume.) Diffusivity in all cases rose or remained steady with increasing confining pressure. The pressure effect was strongest at lowest pressures and vanished by levels between 10 and 100 MPa, depending on rock type. The pressure effect (measured as a percentage change in diffusivity) is stronger in the four rocks of granitic composition than in the three of basaltic composition. Our results agree well with existing thermal diffusivity measurements at atmospheric pressure.}

Traditionally, both modes have been modeled sepa- rately, with the Biot mechanism treated in a macroscopic framework, and the squirt flow examined at the individ- ual pore level. We offer a model which treats both mechanisms as coupled processes and relates P-velocity and attenuation to macroscopic parameters: the Biot poroelastic constants, porosity, permeability, fluid compressibility and viscosity, and a newly introduced micro- scale parameter-a characteristic squirt-flow length. The latter is referred to as a fundamental rock property that can be determined experimentally. We show that the squirt-flow mechanism dominates the Biot mechanism and is responsible for measured large velocity disper- sion and attenuation values. The model directly relates P-velocity and attenuation to measurable rock and fluid properties. Therefore, it allows one to realisti- cally interpret velocity dispersion and/or attenuation in terms of fluid properties changes [e.g., viscosity during thermal enhanced oil recovery (EOR)], or to link seismic measurements to reservoir properties. As an example of the latter transformation, we relate permeability to attenuation and achieve good qualita- tive correlation with experimental data. INTRODUCTION},

  abstract = {We estimate velocity/frequency dispersion and attenuation in fully saturated rocks by employing the squirt-flow mechanism of solid/fluid interaction. In this model, pore fluid is squeezed from thin soft cracks into the surrounding large pores. Information about the compliance of these soft cracks at low confining pressures is extracted from high-pressure velocity data. The frequency dependence of squirt-induced pressure in the soft cracks is linked with the porosity and permeability of the soft pore space, and the characteristic squirt-how length. These unknown parameters are combined into one expression that is assumed to be a fundamental rock property that does not depend on frequency. The appropriate value of this expression for a given rock can be found by matching our theoretical predictions with the experimental measurements of attenuation or velocity. The low-frequency velocity limits, as given by our model, are identical to those predicted by Gassmann's formula. The high-frequency limits may significantly exceed those given by the Blot theory: the high-frequency frame bulk modulus is close to that measured at high confining pressure. We have applied our model to D'Euville Limestone, Navajo Sandstone, and Westerly Granite. The model realistically predicts the observed velocity/ frequency dispersion, and attenuation.}

  abstract = {Skip to Next Section Much work has been conducted investigating the primary factors controlling rift architecture, using both computational and laboratory methods. Here, we examine the effects and relative importance that different types of initial weaknesses have on extensional lithospheric deformation style. We find that the type of initial weakness included in the model plays a primary role in determining the subsequent rift mode. Models using single localized weak seeds produce symmetric narrow rifts, irrespective of whether or not strain softening is included, while models that include regions of diffuse weaknesses produce a wide rift mode. Models that include an initial weak fault tend to produce more asymmetric rifting leading to a core complex mode. By distributing the strain laterally over large areas, the ductile lower crust tends to oppose the narrow rift mode forced by the initial weakness. These results suggest that initial weaknesses may play a major role in determining the mode of rifting. Our numerical experiments confirm that low-angle faults can form as the result of rotation of initially high-angle faults. While previous studies have suggested that the rheological and thermal profiles of the lithosphere play the most important role in rift mode determination, our results illustrate that initial weaknesses could play a major role in rift mode determination, highlighting the need to make initial weaknesses a primary consideration when modelling the extensional deformation of the lithosphere.},

The data set was supplemented with a special study of 12 years of ISC phase data which yielded an additional 1.75 {\texttimes} 106 travel time observations for P and S waves. In order to obtain satisfactory agreement with the entire data set we were required to take into account anelastic dispersion. The introduction of transverse isotropy into the outer 220 km of the mantle was required in order to satisfy the shorter period fundamental toroidal and spheroidal modes. This anisotropy also improved the fit of the larger data set. The horizontal and vertical velocities in the upper mantle differ by 2--4\%, both for P and S waves. The mantle below 220 km is not required to be anisotropic. Mantle Rayleigh waves are surprisingly sensitive to compressional velocity in the upper mantle. High Sn velocities, low Pn velocities and a pronounced low-velocity zone are features of most global inversion models that are suppressed when anisotropy is allowed for in the inversion. The Preliminary Reference Earth Model, PREM, and auxiliary tables showing fits to the data are presented.}

  abstract = {Subduction is a fundamental mechanism of material exchange between the planetary interior and the surface. Despite its significance, our current understanding of fluctuating subducting plate area and slab volume flux has been limited to a range of proxy estimates. Here we present a new detailed quantification of subduction zone parameters from the Late Triassic to present day (230--0 Ma). We use a community plate motion model with evolving plate topologies to extract trench-normal convergence rates through time to compute subducting plate areas, and we use seafloor paleo-age grids to estimate the thickness of subducting lithosphere to derive the slab flux through time. Our results imply that slab flux doubled to values greater than 500 km3/yr from 180 Ma in the Jurassic to 130 Ma in the mid-Cretaceous, subsequently halving again towards the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary, largely driven by subduction zones rimming the Pacific ocean basin. The 130 Ma spike can be attributed to a two-fold increase in mid-ocean ridge lengths following the break-up of Pangea, and a coincident increase in convergence rates, with average speeds exceeding 10 cm/yr. With one third of the total 230 - 0 Ma subducted volume entering the mantle during this short {$\sim$}50 Myr period, we suggest this slab superflux drove a surge in slab penetration into the lower mantle and an associated increase in the vigour of mantle return flow. This mid-Cretaceous event may have triggered, or at least contributed to, the formation of the Darwin Rise mantle superswell, dynamic uplift of the South African Plateau and the plume pulse that produced the Ontong-Java-Hikurangi-Manihiki and Kerguelen plateaus, among others. The models presented here contribute to an improved understanding of the time-evolving flux of material consumed by subduction, and suggest that slab superflux may be a general feature of continental dispersal following supercontinent breakup. These insights may be useful for better understanding how supercontinent cycles are related to transient episodes of Large Igneous Province and superswell formation, and the associated deep cycling of minerals and volatiles, as well as leading to a better understanding of tectonic drivers of long-term climate and icehouse-to-greenhouse transitions.},

  abstract = {The Taupo Volcanic Zone has a 120-km-long section of rhyolitic volcanism, within which is a 60-km-long area of supervolcanoes. The underlying subducted slab has along-strike heterogeneity due to the Hikurangi Plateau's prior subduction history. We studied 3-D Qs (1/attenuation) using t{$\ast$} spectral decay from local earthquakes to 370-km depth. Selection emphasized those events with data quality to sample the low Qs mantle wedge, and Qs inversion used varied linking of nodes to obtain resolution in regions of sparse stations, and 3-D initial model. The imaged mantle wedge has a 250-km-long 150-km-wide zone of low Qs ({$<$}300) at 65--85 km depth which includes two areas of very low Qs ({$<$}120). The most pronounced low Qs feature underlies the Mangakino and Whakamaru super-eruptive calderas, with inferred melt ascending under the central rift structure. The slab is characterized by high Qs (1200--2000), with a relatively small area of reduction in Qs ({$<$}800) underlying Taupo at 65-km depth, and adjacent to the mantle wedge low Qs. This suggests abundant dehydration fluids coming off the slab at specific locations and migrating near-vertically upward to the volcanic zone. The seismicity in the subducted slab has a patch of dense seismicity underlying the rhyolitic volcanic zone, consistent with locally abundant fractures and fluid flux. The relationship between the along-arc and downdip slab heterogeneity and dehydration implies that patterns of volcanism may be strongly influenced by large initial outer rise hydration which occurred while the edge of the Hikurangi Plateau hindered subduction. A second very low Qs feature is 50-km west above the 140-km-depth slab. The distinction suggests involvement of a second dehydration peak at that depth, consistent with some numerical models.},

Early volcanic activity formed a subaqueous edifice of pillow lava and associated hyaloclastite, above which lies a pahoehoe flow. Subsequent subaerial eruptions produced pyroclastic flows, plains-type lava flows and scoria deposits. Lava flow features which are the best preserved examples of their type in Victoria include pillows with multiple crusts and hollow tubes, hyaloclastite, pahoehoe flows with ropy and spongy lava textures and gas-formed canals. Extensive erosion has exposed much of the internal structure of the volcano, including a volcanic vent at Pinnacle Point. The steep and near-continuous coastal cliffs preserve numerous different ancient sea level markers as wave-cut platforms, sea caves, a stranded boulder beach, and the transition from subaqueous to subaerial lava textures. Ancient wave-cut platforms also occur beneath present sea level. Bulk rock major and minor element variation indicate that all the lavas of the island belong to the same source, are not highly fractionated, and ascended rapidly through the crust to the surface. They have alkaline compositions that closely resemble that of typical ocean island basalt.},

  abstract = {Magnetic measurements as a function of temperature and time are commonly used to reconstruct the volume distribution of superparamagnetic (SP) particles. Knowledge of the temperature dependence of the magnetic moments and the anisotropy energies is necessary for a correct interpretation of the measurements. Temperature dependences are usually derived from bulk magnetic properties. The magnetic properties of small particles, however, are strongly influenced by surface effects related to low-temperature oxidation, reduced coordination of surface spins and interactions with surrounding molecules. These effects are difficult to quantify, especially in rocks and sediments. To address this problem, a method for reconstructing the magnetic properties of weakly interacting assemblages of SP particles is presented. The method is based on the inversion of magnetic susceptibility measurements performed for a range of temperatures at different frequencies. The redundancy of the measurements is used to obtain estimates of the abovementioned temperature dependences, the effective interaction field and the pre-exponential factor in N{\'e}el-Brown relaxation theory without using any a priori assumptions on the magnetic properties of the particles. The inversion method was successfully tested on numerical samples representing typical susceptibility measurements of natural and artificial samples. Susceptibility inversion results can provide new insights in the magnetic properties of fine particles relevant in palaeo- and environmental magnetism.},

Well observations, seismic reflection times, and seismic amplitude versus offset (AVO) attributes are integrated in this study to predict the distribution of the reservoir variables, i.e., facies and fluid filling. The prediction problem is cast in a Bayesian setting. The a priori model includes spatial coupling through Markov random field assumptions and intervariable dependencies through nonlinear relations based on rock physics theory, including Gassmann's relation. The likelihood model relating observations to reservoir variables (including lithology facies and pore fluids) is based on approximations to Zoeppritz equations. The model assumptions are summarized in a Bayesian network illustrating the dependencies between the reservoir variables. The posterior model for the reservoir variables conditioned on the available observations is defined by the a priori and likelihood models. This posterior model is not analytically tractable but can be explored by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. Realizations of reservoir variables from the posterior model are used to predict the facies and fluid-filling distribution in the reservoir. A maximum a posteriori (MAP) criterion is used in this study to predict facies and pore-fluid distributions. The realizations are also used to present probability maps for the favorable (sand, oil) occurrence in the reservoir. Finally, the impact of seismic AVO attributes-AVO gradient, in particular-is studied. The approach is demonstrated on real data from a turbidite sedimentary system in the North Sea. AVO attributes on the interface between reservoir and cap rock are extracted from 3D seismic AVO data. The AVO gradient is shown to be valuable in reducing the ambiguity between facies and fluids in the prediction. {\copyright} 2004 Society of Exploration Geophysicists. All rights reserved.},

The FLIP was emplaced during the initial stages of Gondwana break-up from a source suggested to be in the proto-Weddell Sea region. Magma transport from its source (Weddell triple junction) was controlled by an Early Jurassic zone of extension. The FLIP comprises the Dufek intrusion, Ferrar Dolerite sills and dykes (sheet intrusions), and extrusive rocks consisting of pyroclastic strata overlain by Kirkpatrick Basalt lavas. The Dufek intrusion occurs in deformed supracrustal rocks of the foldbelt along the paleo-Pacific Gondwana margin. A few sills were emplaced in basement rocks, but the majority of the sheet intrusions occur in flat-lying Devonian to Triassic Beacon strata. Only in the central Transantarctic Mountains (CTM) and south and north Victoria Land (SVL, NVL) are extrusive rocks preserved overlying Beacon strata. The greatest cumulative thicknesses of magmatic rocks (ca. 2 km) occur in areas where lavas are preserved (CTM and SVL). Sheet intrusions have complex relationships. Dyke swarms (sensu stricto) are unknown and dykes cutting basement rocks are uncommon. Nevertheless, these dykes, including a 30-m-wide dyke in SVL, suggest that some magmas locally migrated up through basement rocks. In CTM and NVL the outcrop belt has a width of about 160 km. Sills originally extended farther toward the plate margin but have been cut out by erosion and Cenozoic faulting, most clearly in CTM; geophysical data suggest extension under the East Antarctic ice sheet for at least 100 km. Although Early Jurassic extension is documented in CTM, major rift-bounding faults have not been observed. Models for magma emplacement include transport along the axis of the Transantarctic Mountains and off-axis transport from major rift-bounding faults. Contrasts in geochemistry between lavas of NVL (Mg0=6-7\%) and CTM (Mg0=2-4\%) and the presence of massive dolerite bodies (CTM, SVL) suggest discrete episodes and locations of magma emplacement, and that there was no long range interconnection along the mountain range in supracrustal rocks.},

  abstract = {Numerical simulations of sequences of earthquakes and aseismic slip (SEAS) have made great progress over past decades to address important questions in earthquake physics. However, significant challenges in SEAS modeling remain in resolving multiscale interactions between earthquake nucleation, dynamic rupture, and aseismic slip, and understanding physical factors controlling observables such as seismicity and ground deformation. The increasing complexity of SEAS modeling calls for extensive efforts to verify codes and advance these simulations with rigor, reproducibility, and broadened impact. In 2018, we initiated a community code-verification exercise for SEAS simulations, supported by the Southern California Earthquake Center. Here, we report the findings from our first two benchmark problems (BP1 and BP2), designed to verify different computational methods in solving a mathematically well-defined, basic faulting problem. We consider a 2D antiplane problem, with a 1D planar vertical strike-slip fault obeying rate-and-state friction, embedded in a 2D homogeneous, linear elastic halfspace. Sequences of quasi-dynamic earthquakes with periodic occurrences (BP1) or bimodal sizes (BP2) and their interactions with aseismic slip are simulated. The comparison of results from 11 groups using different numerical methods show excellent agreements in long-term and coseismic fault behavior. In BP1, we found that truncated domain boundaries influence interseismic stressing, earthquake recurrence, and coseismic rupture, and that model agreement is only achieved with sufficiently large domain sizes. In BP2, we found that complexity of fault behavior depends on how well physical length scales related to spontaneous nucleation and rupture propagation are resolved. Poor numerical resolution can result in artificial complexity, impacting simulation results that are of potential interest for characterizing seismic hazard such as earthquake size distributions, moment release, and recurrence times. These results inform the development of more advanced SEAS models, contributing to our further understanding of earthquake system dynamics.},

We show that flattened mantle plume heads, which can have radii of {\textbackslash}textgreater1200 km in the uppermost mantle, can heat the overlying lithospheric mantle to temperatures above the diamond stability field. As a consequence, they can destroy diamonds within the roots of Archean cratons, the principal source of diamonds in kimberlites. We quantitatively demonstrate that there is a `sour spot' for this effect that occurs when lithospheric thicknesses are 165--185 km and the plume has a temperature of {\textbackslash}textgreater150 {$^\circ$}C above background mantle. Our model explains why the kimberlites associated with the 370 Ma Yakutsk--Vilyui plume in the Siberian craton are diamondiferous whilst those associated with the younger 250 Ma Siberian Traps plume are barren. We also show that the time required to restore the pre-plume thermal structure of the lithosphere is ca. 75--120 Myr, and that destroyed diamonds may regrow once the plume's thermal effect dissipates. The 1100 Ma Kyle Lake and adjacent 180--150 Ma Attawapiskat kimberlites in the southern Superior craton exemplify this, where the older kimberlites are associated with a narrower diamond window ({\textbackslash}textless30 km) in comparison with the ca. 85 km diamond window of the younger Attawapiskat field.},

  abstract = {I present a general model for true polar wander (TPW), in the context of supercontinents and simple modes of mantle convection. Old, mantle-stationary supercontinents shield their underlying mesosphere from the cooling effects of subduction, and an axis of mantle upwelling is established that is complementary to the downwelling girdle of subduction zones encircling the old supercontinent. The upwelling axis is driven to the equator by TPW, and the old supercontinent fragments at the equator. The prolate axis of upwelling persists as the continental fragments disperse; it is rotationally unstable and can lead to TPW of a different flavor, involving extremely rapid ({\textbackslash}textless or =m/year) rotations or changes in paleolatitude for the continental fragments as they reassemble into a new supercontinent. Only after several hundred million years, when the new supercontinent has aged sufficiently, will the downwelling zone over which it amalgamated be transformed into a new upwelling zone, through the mesospheric shielding process described above. The cycle is then repeated. The model explains broad features of the paleomagnetic database for the interval 1200-200 Ma. Rodinia assembled around Laurentia as that continent experienced occasionally rapid, oscillatory shifts in paleolatitude about a persistent axis on the paleo-equator, an axis that may have been inherited from the predecessor supercontinent Nuna. By 800 Ma, long-lived Rodinia stabilized its equatorial position and disaggregated immediately thereafter. Gondwanaland assembled as its constituent fragments documented rapid, oscillatory shifts of apparent polar wander, here interpreted as TPW. The Gondwanaland-Pangea centroid migrated to the equator immediately prior to Jurassic-Cretaceous breakup. Lack of substantial TPW since 200 Ma may indicate the stabilizing effects of specific plate boundary conditions (i.e., persistent convection patterns in the Tethys-Indian Ocean region), possibly superimposed on a secular geodynamic shift governed by increased lower-mantle viscosity associated with long-term planetary cooling. TPW is a significant geodynamic process that, in terms of continental motions, may even dominate plate tectonics for certain intervals of Earth history. The effects of such rapid TPW may be found among regional tectonics and sea-level changes, and possibly global climate change and biological evolution.},

Detailed seismic surveys at trenches reveal that this part of the oceanic plate could be pervasively hydrated for several kilometres below the crust-mantle boundary4,7. Similarly, heat-flow surveys indicate active fluid circulation within the slab8. Yet, the mechanisms that enable fluids to percolate to such depths in spite of their natural buoyancy remain unclear. Here we use two-dimensional numerical experiments to show that stress changes induced by the bending oceanic plate produce subhydrostatic or even negative pressure gradients along normal faults, favouring downward pumping of fluids. The fluids then react with the crust and mantle surrounding the faults and are stored in the form of hydrous minerals. We suggest that this process is the dominant mechanism of deep slab hydration, although it may be locally aided by the enhancement in porosity due to prefailure dilatancy9, pre-existing cracks10 and migrating fluid-filled cracks11. Our results have implications for the transport of water into the deeper parts of the mantle12, and for further clarifying the seismic anisotropy of slabs13. {\copyright} 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The interpretation of shear-wave splitting above subduction zones has been controversial and none of the inferred models seems to be sufficiently complete to explain the entire range of anisotropic patterns registered worldwide. Here we show that the amount and the geometry of seismic anisotropies measured in the forearc regions of subduction zones strongly depend on the preferred orientation of hydrated faults in the subducting oceanic plate. The anisotropy originates from the crystallographic preferred orientation of highly anisotropic hydrous minerals (serpentine and talc) formed along steeply dipping faults and from the larger-scale vertical layering consisting of dry and hydrated crust-mantle sections whose spacing is several times smaller than teleseismic wavelengths. Fault orientations and estimated delay times are consistent with the observed shear-wave splitting patterns in most subduction zones. {\copyright}2008 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

  abstract = {Subducting oceanic plates carry a considerable amount of water from the surface down to mantle depths and contribute significantly to the global water cycle. A part of these volatiles stored in the slab is expelled at intermediate depths (70--300 km) where dehydration reactions occur. However, despite the fact that water considerably affects many physical properties of rocks, not much is known about the fluid flow path and the interaction with the rocks through which volatiles flow in the slab interior during its dehydration. We performed thermomechanical models (coupled with a petrological database and with incompressible aqueous fluid flow) of a dynamically subducting and dehydrating oceanic plate. Results show that, during slab dehydration, unbending stresses drive part of the released fluids into the cold core of the plate toward a level of strong tectonic under-pressure and neutral (slab-normal) pressure gradients. Fluids progressively accumulate and percolate updip along such a layer forming, together with the upper hydrated layer near the top of the slab, a Double Hydrated Zone (DHZ) where intermediate-depth seismicity could be triggered. The location and predicted mechanics of the DHZ would be consistent with seismological observations regarding Double Seismic Zones (DSZs) found in most subduction zones and suggests that hydrofracturing could be the trigger mechanism for observed intermediate-depth seismicity. In the light of our results, the lower plane of the DSZ is more likely to reflect a layer of upward percolating fluid than a level of mantle dehydration. In our models, a 20--30 km thick DSZ forms in relatively old oceanic plates without requiring an extremely deep slab hydration prior to subduction. The redistribution of fluids into the slab interior during slab unbending also has important implications for slab weakening and the deep water cycle. We estimate that, over the whole of Earth's history, a volume of water equivalent to around one to two oceans can be stored in nominally anhydrous minerals of the oceanic lithosphere and transported to the transition zone by this mechanism, suggesting that mantle regassing could have been efficient even without invoking the formation of high pressure hydrous minerals.},

  abstract = {The geological and geophysical phenomena associated with water in the slab can be grouped into three different categories: those related to 1) the storage of water in the oceanic lithosphere at the surface, 2) the subduction of a hydrated slab and 3) its dehydration that ultimately leads to mantle regassing. Widespread hydration of the uppermost oceanic lithosphere occurs at mid-ocean ridges and more pervasively at the trench-rise system in response to bending-related fracturing and faulting. The amount of water stored in the upper lithosphere appears to be proportional to the spreading slowness and amount of bending. Hydrothermal alteration of the oceanic plate may also occur more locally along transform margins, fracture zones and volcanic ridges. Subduction of a hydrated slab should be observed from a reduction of seismic velocities, anomalous Vp/Vs ratios and seismic anisotropy in its uppermost portions, and shift of the main phase transformation boundaries characteristic of the mantle. Because of the increased buoyancy and weakness, hydrated or wet slabs should tend to stagnate over the 660. km discontinuity, favoring layered mantle convection patterns. Slab dehydration takes place according to the plate thermal regime function of the slab age and sinking velocity. Hydrous minerals in the oceanic crust and mantle are stable down to a maximum of 300. km and 1200. km depth, respectively, after which minor amounts of water can be retained in nominally anhydrous minerals. There is abundant geophysical evidence for dehydration of the slab crust and sub-Moho mantle, while fragmentary and often indirect evidence supports the presence of water in the lower plane of the Double Seismic Zone and at depths {\textbackslash}textgreater. 300. km. {\copyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

We argue that the three-dimensional return flow and slab fragmentation associated with complex oceanic subduction trajectories within the upper mantle can generate focused upwellings and that these may play a significant role in regional tectonics. The testable surface expressions of this process are the outside-arc alkaline volcanism, topographic swell, and low-velocity seismic anomalies associated with partial melt. Using three-dimensional, simplified numerical subduction models, we show that focused upwellings can be generated both ahead of the slab in the back-arc region (though {$\sim$} five times further inward from the trench than arc-volcanism) and around the lateral edges of the slab (in the order of 100 km away from slab edges). Vertical mass transport, and by inference the associated decompression melting, in these regions appears strongly correlated with the interplay between relative trench motion and subduction velocities. The upward flux of material from the depths is expected to be most pronounced during the first phase of slab descent into the upper mantle or during slab fragmentation. We discuss representative case histories from the Pacific and the Mediterranean where we find possible evidence for such slab-related volcanism. {\copyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Gas content of coals continuously change throughout their burial histories as a result of the changing state of equilibrium of the coal-gas system caused by variations in P-T conditions and coal rank. To fully evaluate the prospectivity of a coalbed methane resource, numerous coal properties, burial history, P-T conditions, hydrology and the likelihood of secondary biogenic gas generation need to be considered with respect to gas sorption capacity, gas contents and permeability. Previous studies have given differing interpretations on relationships between rank and maceral composition with sorption capacity. The maximum gas storing capacities for Sydney Basin coals is inversely related to rank up to medium volatile bituminous, but a coked, contact metamorphosed coal has an elevated capacity. Comparison of sorption capacities of coals having similar ranks and variable maceral group composition, indicate that rank has a dominating effect over any effects of organic matter type. For the Sydney Basin coals, the in-situ gas contents, on average, increase with depth up to about 600 m and with further increases in depth to 900 m, the gas contents tend to plateau or even decrease. Such a trend probably is consistent with the combined effects of pressure and temperature on the gas sorption capacity during the geological history. R-mode cluster analyses of the coal and gas properties yield a positive correlation between gas contents and inertinite abundance. This is related to undersaturation of the vitrinite-rich coals, possibly due to higher permeability and consequent leakage of more gas from vitrinite-rich coals than from inertinite-rich coals. Although a large amount of methane and other hydrocarbon gases would have been generated in the Sydney Basin at maximum burial during the Early Cretaceous, a large proportion of the gas might not have been sorbed within the coal due to limited gas sorption capacities and enhanced diffusivity at high temperatures. Upon uplift, gas that migrated from deeper in the sequence or from shallower biological activity may have been sorbed into the coals. Without secondary gas replenishment however, many of these coals remain significantly undersaturated. The areas that contain considerable amounts of secondary biogenic gas are highly prospective for coalbed methane production partly because of the higher gas contents, but also because of the higher permeability, which is required for access of the microbes and nutrients in meteoric waters. To fully evaluate prospectivity of coalbed methane resources, numerous coal properties, burial history, geologic setting and the likelihood of secondary biogenic gas generation need to be considered with respect to gas sorption capacity, gas contents and permeability. {\copyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {SUMMARY We investigate the use of general, non-l 2 measures of data misfit and model structure in the solution of the non-linear inverse problem. Of particular interest are robust measures of data misfit, and measures of model structure which enable piecewise-constant models to be constructed. General measures can be incorporated into traditional linearized, iterative solutions to the non-linear problem through the use of an iteratively reweighted least-squares (IRLS) algorithm. We show how such an algorithm can be used to solve the linear inverse problem when general measures of misfit and structure are considered. The magnetic stripe example of Parker (1994) is used as an illustration. This example also emphasizes the benefits of using a robust measure of misfit when outliers are present in the data. We then show how the IRLS algorithm can be used within a linearized, iterative solution to the non-linear problem. The relevant procedure contains two iterative loops which can be combined in a number of ways. We present two possibilities. The first involves a line search to determine the most appropriate value of the trade-off parameter and the complete solution, via the IRLS algorithm, of the linearized inverse problem for each value of the trade-off parameter. In the second approach, a schedule of prescribed values for the trade-off parameter is used and the iterations required by the IRLS algorithm are combined with those for the linearized, iterative inversion procedure. These two variations are then applied to the 1-D inversion of both synthetic and field time-domain electromagnetic data. There have been a number of reports of the use of robust 1 INTRODUC TION measures of misfit in geophysical inverse problems. Claerbout In this paper we investigate the solution of the non-linear \& Muir (1973) espouse the merits of an l 1 measure when a set inverse problem using measures other than the typical sum-of observations contains outliers or 'infinite blunders'. In the of-squares, or l 2 , measure. Our motivation is two-fold. First, context of the 1-D seismic inverse problem, Gersztenkorn, we would like our solution to be less influenced by outliers Bednar \& Lines (1986) illustrate the superiority of a solution obtained using an l 1 measure over one obtained using an l 2 and other non-Gaussian noise, that is to be more robust, than when an l 2 measure of data misfit is used. Second, we would measure when spikes (i.e. outliers) are present in the seismic trace. Scales, Gersztenkorn \& Treitel (1988) provide a similar like to be able to construct models that are piecewise constant, or 'blocky', and therefore more in accord with the geology of illustration of the robustness of an l 1 measure in the context of seismic tomography. Both sets of authors use an iteratively certain regions than the smooth, 'smeared-out' images obtained using an l 2 measure of model structure. These two aims can reweighted least-squares algorithm. Crase et al. (1990) provide another illustration of the benefits of robust measures of misfit be achieved with the use of judiciously chosen measures of data misfit and model structure, for example an l 1 measure, or when they compare the results of seismic waveform inversion using a number of robust measures and the traditional l 2 the measure related to the 'most robust' of the M-estimators of Huber (1964). Traditional linearized, iterative inversion measure. Amundsen (1991) likewise provides a comparison for seismic frequency--wavenumber inversion. In an application to procedures can be modified to handle such non-l 2 measures by the inclusion of an iteratively reweighted least-squares gravity data, Beltr{\~a}o, Silva \& Costa (1991) use a robust measure when fitting polynomials to observations to determine algorithm.},

The obvious forward solver for this type of Earth model is one that calculates the gravity contribution from each cell in the mesh using one of the closed-form formulae for a right rectangular prism. However, such a solver is computationally expensive, especially in memory requirements, when implemented without modification in a Newton, or Gauss-Newton, inversion procedure. Here, an alternative method is presented that involves a finite-difference solution of Poisson's equation. First, the finite-difference equations are derived for a rectangular mesh using a finite-volume approach. A linear system of equations is generated which is sparse. The solution to the system, which is the approximation to the gravitational potential, is obtained using a conjugate-gradient procedure. This maintains the sparseness of the system, and is thus efficient in memory usage. Finally, components of the gravitational acceleration are computed from the approximate potential using a finite-difference approximation of the gradient operator. The capabilities of this forward solver are illustrated by a simple example. The method is particularly suited to gradient-based inversion programs that compute the model update using an iterative procedure and evaluate the requisite matrix-vector products by means of a pseudo-forward solution. {\copyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Selection among alternative theoretical models given an observed data set is an important challenge in many areas of physics and astronomy. Reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) is an extremely powerful technique for performing Bayesian model selection, but it suffers from a fundamental difficulty: it requires jumps between model parameter spaces, but cannot retain a memory of the favored locations in more than one parameter space at a time. Thus, a naive jump between parameter spaces is unlikely to be accepted in the MCMC algorithm and convergence is correspondingly slow. Here we demonstrate an interpolation technique that uses samples from single-model MCMCs to propose inter-model jumps from an approximation to the single-model posterior of the target parameter space. The interpolation technique, based on a kD-tree data structure, is adaptive and efficient in arbitrary dimensions. We show that our technique leads to dramatically improved convergence over naive jumps in an RJMCMC, and compare it to other proposals in the literature to improve the convergence of RJMCMCs. We also discuss the use of the same interpolation technique in two other contexts: as a convergence test for a single-model MCMC and as a way to construct efficient "global" proposal distributions for single-model MCMCs without prior knowledge of the structure of the posterior distribution.},

The resultant flow in the upper mantle is driven by a combination of bottom heated convection and applied shear velocity boundary conditions that represents plate motion. Both the plate velocity and continental lithosphere topography are varied in a way to assess the general influence of 3D geometry as well as a more specific tectonic analogue of the Australian plate. Transient thermal events offshore of the trailing passive margin are observed and include plume migration, boundary layer instability growth at the passive margin and variations in surface heat flux. The geometry and plate velocity both play a significant role in controlling the magnitude and duration of these transient features. In particular, there are large differences between the different models in the oceanic region downstream of the trailing edge of the continent. At near-stationary plate speeds, cold linear downwelling sheets propagate away from the 3D edge of the continent, with regions offshore of the continents central axis localising hot cylindrical upwelling plumes. At very fast plate speeds, the shear flow is dominated by the plate motions. This causes regions neighbouring the trailing edge of the continent to produce broad, hot upwellings and the cold linear sheets to migrate around the continent. At moderate (2cm/yr) plate speeds, oceanic lithosphere neighbouring the passive margin along the trailing edge of the continent is buffered by cold, downwelling instabilities sinking along the edges of the continental lithosphere. Such neighbouring regions are subjected to larger heat flux than for regions distant to the passive margin, yet also record smaller and less variable vertical surface velocities. These dynamics have implications for volcanism and surface topography, for which 3D aspects play a significant role.},

  abstract = {Subduction of tectonic plates into Earth's mantle occurs when one plate bends beneath another at convergent plate boundaries. The characteristic time of deformation at these convergent boundaries approximates the Maxwell relaxation time for olivine at lithospheric temperatures and pressures, it is therefore by definition a viscoelastic process. While this is widely acknowledged, the large-scale features of subduction can, and have been, successfully reproduced assuming the plate deforms by a viscous mechanism alone. However, the energy rates and stress profile within convergent margins are influenced by viscoelastic deformation. In this study, viscoelastic stresses have been systematically introduced into numerical models of free subduction, using both the viscosity and shear modulus to control the Maxwell relaxation time. The introduction of an elastic deformation mechanism into subduction models produces deviations in both the stress profile and energy rates within the subduction hinge when compared to viscous only models. These variations result in an apparent viscosity that is variable throughout the length of the plate, decreasing upon approach and increasing upon leaving the hinge. At realistic Earth parameters, we show that viscoelastic stresses have a minor effect on morphology yet are less dissipative at depth and result in an energy transfer between the energy stored during bending and the energy released during unbending. We conclude that elasticity is important during both bending and unbending within the slab hinge with the resulting stress loading and energy profile indicating that slabs maintain larger deformation rates at smaller stresses during bending and retain their strength during unbending at depth.},

[2004] consistently show a peak in attenuation that is absent from melt-free aggregates tested under similar conditions and grain sizes. Characterization by SEM shows that the melt resides in triple junction tubules and larger pockets as previously described. TEM imaging and EDS analysis reveals that olivine-olivine grain boundaries are characterized by a region {$\leq$}1 nm wide which is structurally and chemically distinct from olivine grain interiors. From the possible mechanisms that can produce an anelastic attenuation peak, melt squirt can be eliminated for our samples and experimental conditions. We attribute the observed attenuation peak to elastically accommodated grain boundary sliding, requiring that the grain boundaries are weak relative to olivine grain interiors but have a significantly higher viscosity than bulk melt. While the nanometer scale grain boundary structure in the melt-bearing aggregates is essentially the same as for melt-free aggregates studied previously, elastically accommodated sliding in the latter is apparently inhibited by tight three-grain edge intersections. The exponentially increasing high temperature background attenuation in both types of aggregate is attributed to diffusionally accommodated grain boundary sliding. Extrapolation to mantle grain sizes shows that the broad peak may be responsible for nearly frequency independent attenuation in partially molten regions of the upper mantle.},

  abstract = {New Re--Os age determinations from the Galway Granite (samples: KMG = 402.2 {\textpm} 1.1 Ma, LLG = 399.5 {\textpm} 1.7 Ma and GBM = 383.3 {\textpm} 1.1 Ma) show that in south Connemara, late Caledonian granite-related molybdenite mineralization extended from c. 423 Ma to c. 380 Ma. These events overlap and are in excellent agreement with the published granite emplacement history determined by U--Pb zircon geochronology. The spatial distribution of the late-Caledonian Connemara granites indicates that initial emplacement and molybdenite mineralization occurred at c. 420 Ma (that is, the Omey Granite and probably the Inish, Leterfrack and Roundstone granites) to the N and NW of the Skird Rocks Fault, an extension of the orogen-parallel Southern Uplands Fault in western Ireland. A generally southern and eastward progression of granite emplacement (and molybdenite mineralization) sited along the Skird Rocks Fault then followed, at c. 410 Ma (Roundstone Murvey and Carna granites), at c. 400 Ma (Errisbeg Townland Granite, Megacrystic Granite, Mingling Mixing Zone Granodiorite, Lough Lurgan Granite and Kilkieran Murvey Granite) and at c. 380 Ma (Costelloe Murvey Granite, Shannapheasteen and Knock granites). The duration of granite magmatism and mineralization in Connemara is similar to other sectors of the Appalachian--Caledonian orogeny and several tectonic processes (e.g. slab-breakoff, asthenospheric flow, transtension and decompression) may account for the duration and variety of granite magmatism of the western Irish Caledonides.},

  abstract = {The Lapstone Structural Complex is an association of monoclines and high-angle reverse faults that occupies the frontal ridge of the lower Blue Mountains, west of Sydney. Permian-Triassic movements have been proposed on the basis of unpublished seismic profiles reportedly showing abrupt stratigraphic thickness variations in the Sydney Basin succession across the Lapstone Structural Complex and indicative of syn-depositional deformation. In a companion paper, we present an interpretation of recently reprocessed seismic data and show that the Lapstone Structural Complex played no role during Sydney Basin sedimentation. Paleomagnetic data collected from two monoclines are interpreted to bracket development of the Lapstone Structural Complex within the mid-Cretaceous to Miocene interval. Cenozoic uplift of the frontal ridge of the lower Blue Mountains is shown by uplifted semi-consolidated gravels (Rickabys Creek Gravel). A Paleogene timing of uplift was proposed from modelling of landscape development. Association of structures of the Lapstone Structural Complex with the uplifted lower Blue Mountains is most simply explained by a Paleogene age for these structures. Evidence for additional neotectonic activity along the Lapstone Structural Complex reflects the modern compressive stress regime associated with the transpressional plate boundary in the South Island of New Zealand. A Paleogene age for the uplift of the Blue Mountains is consistent with the high relief of this region in contrast to more stable regions of the highlands of eastern Australia characterised by low local relief, reflecting antiquity. {\copyright} 2011 Geological Society of Australia.},

  abstract = {[1] Common geological, geochemical, and geophysical characteristics of continental fragments of East Gondwana and adjacent oceanic lithosphere define a long-lived, low-volume, diffuse alkaline magmatic province (DAMP) encompassing the easternmost part of the Indo-Australian Plate, West Antarctica, and the southwest portion of the Pacific Plate. A key to generating the Cenozoic magmatism is the combination of metasomatized lithosphere underlain by mantle at only slightly elevated temperatures, in contrast to large igneous provinces where mantle temperatures are presumed to be high. The SW Pacific DAMP magmatism has been conjecturally linked to rifting, strike- slip faulting, mantle plumes, or hundreds of hot spots, but all of these associations have flaws. We suggest instead that sudden detachment and sinking of subducted slabs in the late Cretaceous induced Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities along the former Gondwana margin that in turn triggered lateral and vertical flow of warm Pacific mantle. The interaction of the warm mantle with metasomatized subcontinental lithosphere that characterizes much of the SW Pacific DAMP concentrates magmatism along zones of weakness. The model may also provide a mechanism for warming south Pacific mantle and resulting Cenozoic alkaline magmatism, where the oceanic areas are characterized primarily, but not exclusively, by short-lived hot spot tracks not readily explained by conventional mantle plume theory. This proposed south Pacific DAMP is much larger and longer- lived than previously considered.},

  abstract = {During the last 20 years, seismic tomography has frequently been used to provide information on the structure of the lithosphere beneath the Australian continent. New tomographic models are presented using two complementary seismological techniques in order to illustrate the current state-ofknowledge. Surface wave tomography is the ideal method to obtain information of velocity variations across the whole continent. The latest models use data from over 13 000 source--receiver paths, allowing a higher resolution than in previous studies using the same technique. In Western Australia the results at 100 km depth clearly reveal the contrast in structure between the Pilbara and Yilgarn Cratons and the Capricorn Orogen. At greater depths, the Kimberley Block has a distinct fast velocity anomaly in comparison with the surrounding mobile belts. In the east of the continent, strong horizontal gradients in velocity indicate transitions in lithospheric structure, although the new high resolution models reveal a complexity in the transitions through central Victoria and New South Wales. Complementing the surface wave tomography, we also present the results from the inversion of over 25 000 relative arrival times from body wave phases recorded in southeast Australia and Tasmania. The body wave tomography uses the surface wave model to provide information on long-wavelength structure and absolute velocities that would otherwise be lost. The new results indicate a distinct boundary between the Delamerian and Lachlan orogens within the upper mantle, the location of which is consistent with an east-dipping Moyston Fault, as observed by deep seismic reflection profiling. The new models also confirm a distinct region of fast velocities beneath the central sub province of the Lachlan Orogen. A significant new observation is that the inferred eastern edge of this central sub-province has a strong correlation with the location of copper/gold deposits; a similar relationship is observed at a larger scale in Western Australia where mineral deposits appear to flank the regions of fastest velocity within the West Australian Craton.},

The new images incorporate data from the recent Tasmal experiment, improving resolution in continental Australia. Through comparisons with surface geology and geochemical studies, it is possible to infer that the steps in lithospheric thickness are related to boundaries between blocks of different age. The westernmost boundary marks the edge of the Archaean to Early-Proterozoic core of the continent. A second lithospheric boundary is observed in the central part of east Australia. To the west of this line, geochemical evidence suggests that there is Proterozoic lithospheric mantle, and this boundary may therefore represent the change from Proterozoic to Phanerozoic basement. The structure on the eastern margin of the continent is dominated by slow velocities, suggesting that in this area the continental lithosphere is very thin. There is a strong correlation between the slow wave speeds and the location of both the highest topography and recent volcanic activity. Inland of the continental margin, a zone of strong gradients in the seismic wave speed is observed, indicating a distinct step in lithospheric structure. If the step in lithospheric thickness was in place prior to volcanism, it may have acted as a boundary, with volcanism mainly occurring beneath the thinner lithosphere to the east.},

  abstract = {Basaltic lavas, forming thick offshore seaward-dipping reflector sequences (SDRS) and onshore igneous provinces around the North Atlantic margins, represent melting of anomalously hot mantle in the head of the ancestral Iceland plume. Some of these lavas are chemically and isotopically indistinguishable from recent Icelandic basalt, but others more closely resemble basalt erupted at normal segments of mid-ocean ridges (N-MORB). In this paper we show that Icelandic basalt and N-MORB define parallel tight arrays on a plot of log(Nb/Y) against log(Zr/Y), with N-MORB relatively deficient in Nb. Deficiency or excess of Nb, relative to the lower bound of the Iceland array, may be expressed as ANb = 1.74 + log(Nb/Y) -1.92 log(Zr/Y) such that Icelandic basalt has ANb {\textbackslash}textgreater 0 and N-MORB has ANb {\textbackslash}textless 0. ANb is a fundamental source characteristic and is insensitive to the effects of variable degrees of mantle melting, source depletion through melt extraction, crustal contamination of the magmas, or subsequent alteration. We use new and published Nb, Zr and Y data to identify the mantle sources for Palaeocene and Eocene basaltic lavas erupted around the Atlantic margins in order to deduce the thermal and compositional structure of the head of the ancestral Iceland plume. The results show that the head of the plume was zoned, with an axial zone of Icelandic mantle surrounded by a thick outer shell of anomalously hot but compositionally normal N-MORB-source mantle. The zoning is very similar in scale and character to that seen today along the Reykjanes Ridge and is difficult to reconcile with the initiation of rifting and SDRS formation through the impact of a large plume head originating solely from the lower mantle. The thick outer shell of hot, depleted upper mantle, which formed more than half the volume of the plume head, suggests that at least part of the plume originated in the thermal boundary layer at the base of the upper mantle. 0 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.},

  abstract = {Thermal history is an important control on generation of gas and oil in source rocks. Therefore, a realistic treatment of thermal conductivity in rocks is essential for hydrocarbon generation modeling in sedimentary basins. We present two different techniques for thermal conductivity estimation: (1) upscaling, based on arithmetic, geometrical and harmonic mean values of averaged conductivity from anticipated mineral composition; (2) infometric regression of thermal conductivity and anisotropy from measurements in rocks of known porosity and mineral composition. The accuracy of the estimate depends on the technique and we expect that the most precise way to predict thermal conductivity of sedimentary rocks leads to considerable improvement in the accuracy of basin modeling and hydrocarbon prospect identification. Various thermal conductivity models based on porosity and lithology are used for modeling temperature history for sensitivity purposes. Models where matrix conductivity is determined from measured thermal conductivities based on the mineralogy give considerably lower strata temperatures than models where geometrically averaged matrix conductivity are determined from mineralogy. This is assumed to be caused by deficiency in the mixing laws not taking into account the texture effect of the sediments. The temperature histories estimated by the three mixing law models--arithmetic, geometrical and harmonic mean--are considerably different. We show that the mixing law models give a temperature history and predicted hydrocarbon maturation far off even if we have temperature measurement at the same location. For example the harmonic model predicts the onset of the maturation of the Jurassic formations 20 million years later than does the model based on measured conductivities.},

  abstract = {The Cenozoic evolution of South American topography is marked by episodes of large-scale uplift and subsidence not readily explained by lithospheric deformation. The drying up of the inland Pebas system, the drainage reversal of the Amazon river, the uplift of the Sierras Pampeanas and the uplift of Patagonia have all been linked to the evolution of mantle flow since the Miocene in separate studies. Here we investigate the evolution of long-wavelength South American topography as a function of subduction history in a time-dependent global geodynamic model. This model is shown to be consistent with these inferred changes, as well as with the migration of the Chaco foreland basin depocentre, that we partly attribute to the inboard migration of subduction resulting from Andean mountain building. We suggest that the history of subduction along South America has had an important influence on the evolution of the topography of the continent because time-dependent mantle flow models are consistent with the history of vertical motions as constrained by the geological record at four distant areas over a whole continent. Testing alternative subduction scenarios reveals flat slab segments are necessary to reconcile inferred Miocene shorelines with a simple model paleogeography. As recently suggested, we find that the flattening of a subduction zone results in dynamic uplift between the leading edge of the flat slab segment and the trench, and in a wave of dynamic subsidence associated with the inboard migration of the leading edge of flat subduction. For example, the flattening of the Peruvian subduction contributed to the demise of Pebas shallow-water sedimentation, while continental-scale tilting also contributed to the drainage reversal of the Amazon River. The best correlation to P-wave tomography models for the Peruvian flat slab segment is obtained for a case when the asthenosphere, here considered to be 150 km thick and 10 times less viscous than the upper mantle, is restricted to the oceanic domain.},

  abstract = {Earth's large-scale topography and lower-mantle structure are linked to past tectonic motions and mantle flow, making it possible to gain insights in the properties of the solid Earth from time-dependent global convection models driven by tectonic reconstructions. Recent work suggests that the amplitude of residual topography, obtained by subtracting models of isostatic topography from total topography, may be up to {$\sim$}1000 m at spherical harmonic degree two (wavelength {$\sim$}13 300 km) and {\textbackslash}textgreater 200 m at spherical harmonic degree 12 (wavelength {$\sim$}3000 km). The amplitude of dynamic topography and the structure of the lower mantle predicted by time-dependent forward mantle flow models both depend on the physical assumption and on model parameters. Here, I investigate the consequence of using the Boussinesq, extended Boussinesq or truncated anelastic liquid approximation (TALA) in time-dependent flow models for predicting present-day mantle structure and dynamic topography; I characterize the sensitivity of the spectral distribution of dynamic topography amplitude to the boundary conditions and model set-up for the computation of dynamic topography; and I investigate the sensitivity of model results to parameters including the depth- and temperature dependence of viscosity, the model initial age and the density of the basal layer. Extended Boussinesq and TALA models are preferred to Boussinesq models that overpredict the volume of lower-mantle slabs and the amplitude of long-wavelength dynamic topography. The correlation between dynamic and residual topography models for spherical harmonic degrees 1-3 generally ranges between 0.4 and 0.5. The flow models better predict the geographical location of large low shear velocity provinces than that of lower-mantle slabs, which cover smaller areas in map view. I show that preserving shallow lateral viscosity variations in the computation of dynamic topography increases the amplitude of dynamic topography for wavelengths {\textbackslash}textgreater 6000 km. Parameter trade-offs exist to fit both deep and surface constraints. The best-fitting model cases considered either a moderately dense basal layer (approximately 2 per cent denser than ambient mantle) or weak temperature- and pressure dependence of lower-mantle viscosity. The fit to present-day constraints does not significantly deteriorate when extending the reconstruction of mantle flow from 200 to 410 Ma, reflecting that seismic tomography models capture the history of mantle convection over the last 200-250 Myr, and suggesting that palaeogeographically constrained mantle flow models should be compared to time-dependent surface geological constraints.},

  abstract = {The magma sources for granitic intrusions related to the Mesozoic White Mountain magma series in northern New England, USA, are addressed relying principally upon Nd isotopes. Many of these anorogenic complexes lack significant volumes of exposed mafic lithologies and have been suspected of representing crustal melts. Sm-Nd and Rb-Sr isotope systematics are used to evaluate magma sources for 18 felsic plutons with ages ranging from about 120 to 230 Ma. The possibility of crustal sources is further examined with analyses of representative older crust including Paleozoic granitoids which serve as probes of the lower crust in the region. Multiple samples from two representative intrusions are used to address intraplution initial isotopic heterogeneities and document significant yet restricted variations ({\textbackslash}textless approximately 1 in epsilon-Nd). Overall, Mesozoic granite plutons range in epsilon-Nd [T] from +4.2 to -2.3, with most +2 to 0, and in initial Sr-87/Sr-86 from 0.7031 to approximately 0.709. The isotopic variations are roughly inversely correlated but are not obviously related to geologic, geographic, or age differences. Older igneous and metamorphic crust of the region has much lower Nd isotope ratios with the most radiogenic Paleozoic granitoid at epsilon-Nd [180 Ma] of -2.8. These data suggest mid-Proterozoic separation of the crust in central northern New England. Moreover, the bulk of the Mesozoic granites cannot be explained as crustal melts but must have large mantle components. The ranges of Nd and Sr isotopes are attributed to incorporation of crust by magmas derived from midly depleted mantle sources. Crustal input may reflect either magma mixing of crustal and mantle melts or crustal assimilation which is the favored interpretation. The results indicate production of anorogenic granites from mantle-derived mafic magmas.},

Specifically, we determine the conditions under which such planets can maintain rates of CO2 degassing large enough to prevent global surface glaciation but small enough so as not to exceed the upper limit on weathering rates provided by the supply of fresh rock, a situation which would lead to runaway atmospheric CO2 accumulation and an inhospitably hot climate. The models show that stagnant lid planets with initial radiogenic heating rates of 100--250 TW, and with total CO2 budgets ranging from *10-2 to 1 times Earth's estimated CO2 budget, can maintain volcanic outgassing rates suitable for habitability for \&1--5 Gyr; larger CO2 budgets result in uninhabitably hot climates, while smaller budgets result in global glaciation. High radiogenic heat production rates favor habitability by sustaining volcanism and CO2 outgassing longer. Thus, the results suggest that plate tectonics may not be required for establishing a long-term carbon cycle and maintaining a stable, habitable climate. The model is necessarily highly simplified, as the uncertainties with exoplanet thermal evolution and outgassing are large. Nevertheless, the results provide some first-order guidance for future exoplanet missions, by predicting the age at which habitability becomes unlikely for a stagnant lid planet as a function of initial radiogenic heat budget. This prediction is powerful because both planet heat budget and age can potentially be constrained from stellar observations.

  abstract = {For plate tectonics to operate on a planet, mantle convective forces must be capable of forming weak, localized shear zones in the lithosphere that act as plate boundaries. Otherwise, a planet's mantle will convect in a stagnant lid regime, where subduction and plate motions are absent. Thus, when and how plate tectonics initiated on the Earth is intrinsically tied to the ability of mantle convection to form plate boundaries; however, the physics behind this process are still uncertain. Most mantle convection models have employed a simple pseudoplastic model of the lithosphere, where the lithosphere `fails' and develops a mobile lid when stresses in the lithosphere reach the prescribed yield stress. With pseudoplasticity high mantle temperatures and high rates of internal heating, conditions relevant for the early Earth, impede plate boundary formation by decreasing lithospheric stresses, and hence favour a stagnant lid for the early Earth. However, when a model for shear zone formation based on grain size reduction is used, early Earth thermal conditions do not favour a stagnant lid. While lithosphere stress drops with increasing mantle temperature or heat production rate, the deformational work, which drives grain size reduction, increases. Thus, the ability of convection to form weak plate boundaries is not impeded by early Earth thermal conditions. However, mantle thermal state does change the style of subduction and lithosphere mobility; high mantle temperatures lead to a more sluggish, drip-like style of subduction. This `sluggish lid' convection may be able to explain many of the key observations of early Earth crust formation processes preserved in the geologic record. Moreover, this work highlights the importance of understanding the microphysics of plate boundary formation for assessing early Earth tectonics, as different plate boundary formation mechanisms are influenced by mantle thermal state in fundamentally different ways.             This article is part of a discussion meeting issue `Earth dynamics and the development of plate tectonics'.},

  abstract = {The Archaean oceanic crust was probably thicker than present-day oceanic crust owing to higher heat flow and thus higher degrees of melting at mid-ocean ridges1. These conditions would also have led to a different bulk composition of oceanic crust in the early Archaean, that would probably have consisted of magnesium-rich picrite (with variably differentiated portions made up of basalt, gabbro, ultramafic cumulates and picrite). It is unclear whether these differences would have influenced crustal subduction and recycling processes, as experiments that have investigated the metamorphic reactions that take place during subduction have to date considered only modern mid-ocean-ridge basalts2,3. Here we present data from high-pressure experiments that show that metamorphism of ultramafic cumulates and picrites produces pyroxenites, which we infer would have delaminated and melted to produce basaltic rocks, rather than continental crust as has previously been thought. Instead, the formation of continental crust requires subduction and melting of garnet-amphibolite4---formed only in the upper regions of oceanic crust---which is thought to have first occurred on a large scale during subduction in the late Archaean5. We deduce from this that shallow subduction and recycling of oceanic crust took place in the early Archaean, and that this would have resulted in strong depletion of only a thin layer of the uppermost mantle. The misfit between geochemical depletion models and geophysical models for mantle convection (which include deep subduction) might therefore be explained by continuous deepening of this depleted layer through geological time5,6.},

  abstract = {The style of subduction that prevailed on the early Earth, or even whether subduction was prevalent at all, is an important question in the evolution of Earth's crust, mantle, and surface environment. Here, two-dimensional numerical convection models, that include grain size evolution to generate weak plate boundaries, reveal a clear transition in subduction behavior with increasing internal heating rate. Sustained subduction with a coherent slab gives way to a style where slabs periodically detach and sink rapidly into the deep mantle, with increasing internal heating rate. In this latter, ``drip-like'' subduction regime, repeating cycles of slab growth by subduction, followed by necking and detachment of the lower portion of the slab, are seen. These cycles are termed ``slab detachment cycles,'' and similar behavior has been seen in regional scale subduction models of the early Earth. Fourier analysis is used to constrain the timescale of slab detachment cycles, and a simple scaling law for this timescale is developed. Applying the scaling law to the early Earth indicates that slab detachment cycles can occur on timescales of {$<$}10 Myr, even as low as {$<$}5 Myr if the lithosphere is thick and mantle temperature is {$>$}1900 K. These cycles may thus be capable of explaining repeating sequences of rocks with ``arc'' and ``non-arc'' signatures seen in some Archean cratons. The drip-like subduction regime could also have significant implications for the generation of the tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite (TTG) suite of rocks and exhumation of high pressure metamorphic rocks, two important features of the early Earth geologic record.},

Climate influences whether plate tectonics can take place on a planet, with cool climates being favorable for plate tectonics because they enhance stresses in the lithosphere, suppress plate boundary annealing, and promote hydration and weakening of the lithosphere. Plate tectonics plays a vital role in the long-term carbon cycle, which helps to maintain a temperate climate. Plate tectonics provides long-term cooling of the core, which is vital for generating a magnetic field, and the magnetic field is capable of shielding atmospheric volatiles from the solar wind. Coupling between climate, mantle, and core can potentially explain the divergent evolution of Earth and Venus. As Venus lies too close to the sun for liquid water to exist, there is no long-term carbon cycle and thus an extremely hot climate. Therefore, plate tectonics cannot operate and a long-lived core dynamo cannot be sustained due to insufficient core cooling. On planets within the habitable zone where liquid water is possible, a wide range of evolutionary scenarios can take place depending on initial atmospheric composition, bulk volatile content, or the timing of when plate tectonics initiates, among other factors. Many of these evolutionary trajectories would render the planet uninhabitable.},

  abstract = {Several primary features of the Iceland region require a posteriori adaptions of the classical plume hypothesis to explain them, which erodes confidence in this model. These include the lack of a time-progressive volcanic track and the paucity of evidence for a seismic anomaly in the lower mantle. Diverse studies suggest a mantle potential temperature anomaly beneath the region of no more than 50-100 K, which is probably insufficient for a thermally buoyant plume. We suggest an alternative model that attributes the enhanced magmatism in the Iceland region to high local mantle fertility from subducted Iapetus oceanic crust trapped in the Laurasian continental mantle lithosphere within the collision zone associated with the Caledonian suture. This crust is recycled into the melt zone locally beneath the mid-Atlantic ridge where isentropic upwelling of eclogitized crust or a crust-peridotite mixture produces excess melt. The production of anomalously large volumes of melt on this part of the spreading ridge has built a zone of thick seismic crust that traverses the whole north Atlantic. A weak, downward continuation of the seismic low-velocity zone into the transition zone between the Charlie Gibbs and Jan Mayen fracture zones may correspond to a component of partial melt, too low to be extractable, that indicates the depth extent of enhanced fusibility or volatiles resulting from the recycled crust. The Iceland region separates two contrasting oceanic tectonic regions to its north and south that may behave independently to some degree. Perhaps as a result of this, it has persistently been characterized by complex and unstable tectonics involving spreading about a parallel pair of ridges, intervening microplates, ridge migrations, and local variations in the spreading direction. These tectonic complexities can explain a number of primary features observed on land in Iceland. A captured microplate that may contain oceanic crust up to {$\sim$}30 m.y. old underlies central Iceland submerged beneath younger lavas. This may account for local thickening of the seismic crust to {$\sim$}40 km there. Eastward-widening, fan-shaped extension about a west-east zone that traverses central Iceland culminates in northwest Vatnajokull and may cause the enhanced volcanism there that is traditionally assumed to indicate the center of a plume. The general locus of spreading has not migrated east as is often suggested in support of an eastward-migrating plume model. The model suggested here attributes the Iceland melting anomaly to structures and processes related to plate tectonics that are sourced in the shallow upper mantle. Similar models may explain other "hotspots." Such models suggest a simplifying view of mantle convection since they require only a single mode of convection, that associated with plate tectonics, and not an additional second independent mode associated with deep mantle plumes. {\copyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Here we present a fully nonlinear inverse method to extract the rock uplift history of the central Andean Plateau from the Cotahuasi River and its tributaries. Our approach is based on an analytical solution to the stream power model that relates elevation to rock uplift history under the assumptions of constant climatic conditions in space and time and spatially invariant rock uplift. We use a Bayesian framework that allows us to quantify the full state of knowledge of model parameters (i.e., uncertainties, trade-offs). The erosional efficiency defines the landscape response time, and this must be determined using independent data. Therefore, using thermochronometric data from the Cotahuasi--Oco{\~n}a Canyon, which record rapid fluvial incision at {$\sim$}13--10Ma, we calibrate our results to infer a rock uplift history for the north-central Andean Plateau. We infer a pulse of rock uplift between 25 and 10Ma at rates as high as 0.25km/My. However, the rock uplift rate inferred during this pulse is not as high as is predicted if the central Andean Plateau grew as a result of loss of unstable lithospheric mantle. Therefore, our results are more consistent with models requiring gradual uplift of the central Andean Plateau.}

The key for the utilisation of this energy resource is to understand the controlling factors of the thermal field in this area. We have therefore built a data-based lithospheric-scale 3D structural model of the Upper Rhine Graben and its adjacent areas. In addition, 3D gravity modelling was performed to constrain the internal structure of the crystalline crust consistent with seismic information. Based on this lithosphere scale 3D structural model the present-day conductive thermal field was calculated and compared to measured temperatures. Our results show that the regional thermal field is mainly controlled by the configuration of the upper crust, which has different thermal properties characteristic for the Variscan and Alpine domains. Temperature maxima are predicted for the Upper Rhine Graben where thick insulating Cenozoic sediments cause a thermal blanketing effect and where the underlying crustal units are characterised by high radiogenic heat production. The comparison of calculated and measured temperatures overall shows a reasonable fit, while locally occuring model deviations indicate where a larger influence of groundwater flow may be expected.}

The density and viscosity of basaltic magma, linked to the atomic structure3,4, control the process of melt separation from the surrounding mantle rocks5--9. Here we use high-pressure and high-temperature experiments and in situ X-ray analysis to assess the properties of basaltic magmas under pressures of up to 5.5GPa. We find that the magmas rapidly become denser with increasing pressure and show a viscosity minimum near 4GPa. Magma mobility---the ratio of the melt--solid density contrast to the magma viscosity--- exhibits a peak at pressures corresponding to depths of 120-- 150 km, within the asthenosphere, up to an order of magnitude greater than pressures corresponding to the deeper mantle and shallower lithosphere. Melts are therefore expected to rapidly migrate out of the asthenosphere. The diminishing mobility of magma in Earth's asthenosphere as the melts ascend could lead to excessive melt accumulation at depths of 80--100km, at the lithosphere--asthenosphere boundary. We conclude that the observed seismic discontinuity at the lithosphere-- asthenosphere boundary records this accumulation of melt. Along},

FA2BOUG computes the complete Bouguer correction (i.e. Bullard A, B and C corrections) for both land and sea points in several spatial domains according to the distance between the topography and the calculation point. In each zone a different algorithm is used. In a distant zone we consider the harmonic spherical expansion of the potential of each right rectangular prism representing an elevation grid point. In an intermediate zone we compute the gravitational attraction produced by each prism using the analytic formula. Finally, an inner zone contribution is divided into two parts: a flat-topped prism with a height equal to the elevation of the calculation point, and four quadrants of a conic prism sloping continuously from each square of the inner zone to the calculation point. The program has been applied to the Atlantic-Mediterranean transition zone to obtain a complete Bouguer anomaly map of the area, integrating available onshore Bouguer anomaly with satellite-derived free-air anomaly data. Positive Bouguer anomalies are found in the Atlantic oceanic domain (240-300 mGal), central and eastern Alboran Basin (40-160 mGal) and SW Iberian Peninsula ({\textbackslash}textgreater40 mGal). Major negative Bouguer anomalies are located beneath the west Alboran Basin ({\textbackslash}textless-40 mGal), the Rif, the Rharb Basin and the Atlas Mountains ({\textbackslash}textless-120 mGal).

The paper gives an overview of the main geophysical electromagnetic techniques/data sets employed in lithospheric and mantle imaging including recent advances using satellite data, and an up-to-date summary of the most relevant laboratory experiments regarding the electrical conductivity of upper mantle minerals for various temperature--pressure--water conditions. The sensitivity of electrical conductivity and other geophysical parameters (density, seismic velocities) of mantle rocks to changes in temperature and composition are presented based on a Monte Carlo method parameter exploration. Finally, a case study in Central Tibet is presented where both seismological (long-period surface wave phase velocities) and electromagnetic (magnetotelluric) data---simultaneously including the constraints offered by topography, surface heat flow and mantle xenoliths---have been integrated. The modelling is based on a self-consistent petrological-geophysical thermodynamic framework where mantle properties are calculated as a function of temperature, pressure, and composition. The Tibetan case study offers an excellent opportunity to illustrate the different and complementary sensitivities of the various data sets used and to show how integrated thermochemical models of the lithosphere can help understand settings with a complex tectonic evolution.},

The tectonic history of Ireland includes early Paleozoic closure of the Iapetus Ocean across the Iapetus Suture Zone (ISZ), and in northeastern Ireland late Paleozoic to early Mesozoic crustal extension, during which thick Permo-Triassic sedimentary successions were deposited, followed by early Cenozoic extrusion of large scale flood basalts. Although the crustal structure in Ireland and neighboring offshore areas is fairly well constrained, with the notable exception of the crust beneath Northern Ireland, the Irish uppermost mantle remains to date relatively unknown. In particular, the nature and extent of a hypothetical interaction between a putative proto Icelandic mantle plume and the Irish and Scottish lithosphere during the Tertiary opening of the North Atlantic has long been discussed in the literature with diverging conclusions. In this work, the present-day thermal and compositional structure of the lithosphere in Ireland is modeled based on a geophysical-petrological approach (LitMod3D) that combines comprehensively a large variety of data (namely elevation, surface heat flow, potential fields, xenoliths and seismic tomography models), reducing the inherent uncertainties and trade-offs associated with classical modeling of those individual data sets. The preferred 3D lithospheric models show moderate lateral density variations in Ireland characterized by a slightly thickened lithosphere along the SW-NE trending ISZ, and a progressive lithospheric thinning from southern Ireland towards the north. The mantle composition in the southern half of Ireland (East Avalonia) is relatively and uniformly fertile (i.e., typical Phanerozoic mantle), whereas the lithospheric composition in the northern half of Ireland (Laurentia) seems to vary from moderately depleted to fertile, in agreement with mantle xenoliths erupted in northwestern Ireland. {\copyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Here, we test an integrated geophysical-petrological inversion of Rayleigh- and Love-wave phase-velocity curves for fine-scale lithospheric structure. The main para- meters of the grid-search inversion are the lithospheric and crustal thicknesses, mantle composition, and bulk density and seismic velocities within the crust. Conductive lithospheric geotherms are computed using P-T-dependent thermal conductivity. Radial anisotropy and seismic attenuation have a substantial effect on the results and are modeled explicitly. Surface topography provides information on the integrated density of the crust, poorly constrained by surface waves alone. Investigating parameter inter-dependencies, we show that accurate surface-wave data and topography can constrain robust lithospheric models. We apply the inversion to central Mongolia, south of the Baikal Rift Zone, a key area of deformation in Asia with debated lithosphere-asthenosphere structure and rifting mechanism, and detect an 80--90 km thick lithosphere with a dense, mafic lower crust and a relatively fertile mantle composition (Mg\# {\textbackslash}textless 90.2). Published measurements on crustal and mantle Miocene and Pleistocene xenoliths are consistent with both the geotherms and the crustal and lithospheric mantle composition derived from our inversion. Topography can be fully accounted for by local isostasy, with no dynamic support required. The mantle structure constrained by the inversion indicates no major thermal anomalies in the shallow sub-lithospheric mantle, consistent with passive rifting in the Baikal Rift Zone.},

In contrast to other available modeling software, LitMod3D is built within an internally consistent thermodynamic-geophysical framework, where all relevant properties are functions of temperature, pressure, and composition. By simultaneously solving the heat transfer, thermodynamic, rheological, geopotential, and isostasy (local and flexural) equations, the program outputs temperature, pressure, surface heat flow, density (bulk and single phase), seismic wave velocities, geoid and gravity anomalies, elevation, and lithospheric strength for any given model. These outputs can be used to obtain thermal and compositional models of the lithosphere and sublithospheric upper mantle that simultaneously fit all available geophysical and petrological observables. We illustrate some of the advantages and limitations of LitMod3D using synthetic models and comparing our predictions with those from other modeling methods. In particular, we show that (1) temperature at midlithosphere depths may be overestimated by as much as 200 K when compositional heterogeneities in the mantle and T-P effects are not considered in lithospheric models and (2) the neglect of mantle phase transformations on gravity-based models in thin-crust settings can result in a significant overestimation and underestimation of the derived crustal thickness and its internal density distribution, respectively.},

The data also contain large unexplained scatter, which has been a separate major issue in the analysis of heat flow within the California Coast Ranges. Here we use numerical models of heat conduction to evaluate the hypothesis that thermal refraction, due to contrasts in thermal conductivity in the subsurface, both produces the observed scatter in heat flow and as a result obscures the thermal signature from frictional heating on a fault that supports large shear stress during slip. Our study focuses on the region around the San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth (SAFOD) near Parkfield, California. Our results show that surface heat flow is most sensitive to the contrast between Tertiary sediments and basement rocks and to wavelengths of basement topography of approximately 10 km. With realistic thermal conductivity contrasts and a reasonable interpretation of this geologic contact, we show that thermal refraction is a plausible explanation for the observed heat flow scatter. However, refraction effects are unable to mask frictional heat generation in a manner consistent with observations. We show that even with large refraction effects, low background heat flow, a regional NW-SE decrease in heat flow, or nonsteady state heat conduction, the data are most consistent with a fault that produces little to no frictional heat.},

The rift basins off NW Europe are mapped as a continuous zone with basement depths of between 5 and 15 km. Maximum basement depths off NE Greenland are 8 km, but these are probably underestimated. Plate reconstructions for Chron C24 ( c. 54 Ma) suggest that the poorly known Ammassalik Basin off SE Greenland may correlate with the northern termination of the Hatton Basin at the conjugate margin. The most prominent feature on the Moho map is the Greenland--Iceland--Faroe Ridge, with Moho depths {\textbackslash}textgreater28 km. Crustal thickness is compiled from the Moho and basement depths. The oceanic crust displays an increased thickness close to the volcanic margins affected by the Iceland plume.}

  abstract = {Our ability to determine constrained estimates of the temperature structure of the continental lithosphere is hindered by the lack of independent observations of temperature within the crust. Presently used techniques for the estimation of crustal temperatures rely primarily on near-surface temperature and heat-flow observations coupled to estimates of crustal structure and associated distribution of thermal parameters within the crust. The achievements of seismic tomography in providing an image of the heterogeneous nature of the Earth's interior may provide an additional tool to help both constrain estimates of thermal structure within the crust and provide a means to evaluate assumptions of the spatial distribution of thermal parameters (thermal conductivity, heat production) within the crust. We have developed preliminary tools which help to exploit the information content of the seismic results as contained in the observed velocity anomalies. These techniques allow thermal-compositional (T-X) tomography of the lithosphere providing a means to separate the temperature from compositional effects in producing velocity anomalies. The resulting thermally dominated seismic structure can then be used (in conjunction with surface heat-flow observations) as an additional constraint on estimates of the temperature structure of the crust.},

  abstract = {Imaging deep active volcanic areas remains a challenge in our understanding of their activity and evolution, especially in subduction zones. Study of magnetic anomalies is appropriate to access such dynamics in depth. The magnetic anomaly pattern of the Lesser Antilles Arc (LAA) subduction is studied through Curie Point Depth (CPD), interpreted as the depth of the 580 {$^\circ$}C isotherm, and developed to better assess the deep thermal structure of the arc. The depth of the estimated CPD exhibits a complex topography. Keeping in mind the overall uncertainty associated with this method, a main doming is evidenced below the Guadeloupe archipelago. Its apex is shifted towards the ancient arc, suggesting a very hot state of the fore-arc/arc domain. To better understand the LAA thermal state, we perform 2D thermo-mechanical simulations of the subduction zone. Recalling that magnetite is a serpentinization by-product, we simulate water transfer triggered by slab dehydration to test the assumption of fore-arc serpentinization suggested by the positive magnetic anomaly in the vicinity of the Guadeloupe archipelago. In this area, the subduction-induced arc lithosphere hydration and related weakening trigger a fast heating of the upper plate by basal convective removal. This process of fast arc lithosphere thinning may apply where simultaneously the volcanic arc is split in two and normal convergence is high enough. As serpentinization strongly decreases P-wave velocity, we propose a new interpretation of a published seismic profile below Guadeloupe. The seismic layer previously interpreted as the arc lower crust may rather be a layer of serpentinized mantle, as supported by spatial correlations between gravimetric and magnetic anomalies. Consequently, at the scale of Guadeloupe Island, the fore-arc Moho would be shallower than initially assumed, with a dome shape more consistent with both the extensive deformation active since the Oligocene in the inner fore-arc and the CPD doming.},

We computed interferometric inter-station Green's functions by cross-correlating the transverse component of ambient noise records retrieved by 61 seismic stations across the UK and Ireland. Group velocity measurements along each possible inter-station path were obtained using frequency-time analysis and converted into a series of inter-station traveltime datasets between 4 and 15 seconds period. Traveltime uncertainties estimated from the standard deviation of dispersion curves constructed by stacking randomly-selected subsets of daily cross-correlations, were observed to be too low to allow reasonable data fits to be obtained during tomography. Data uncertainties were therefore estimated again during the inversion as distance-dependent functionals. We produced Love-wave group velocity maps within 8 different period bands using a fully non-linear tomography method which combines the transdimensional reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (rj-McMC) algorithm with an eikonal raytracer. By modelling exact raypaths at each step of the Markov chain we ensured that the non-linear character of the inverse problem was fully and correctly accounted for. Between 4 and 10 seconds period, the group velocity maps show remarkable agreement with the known geology of the British Isles and correctly identify a number of low-velocity sedimentary basins and high-velocity features. Longer period maps, in which most sedimentary basins are not visible, are instead mainly representative of basement rocks. In a second stage of our study we used the results of tomography to produce a series of Love-wave group velocity dispersion curves across a grid of geographical points focussed around the East Irish Sea sedimentary basin. We then independently inverted each curve using a similar rj-McMC algorithm to obtain a series of one-dimensional shear velocity profiles. By merging all 1D profiles, we created a fully three-dimensional model of the crust beneath the East Irish Sea. The depth to basement in this model compares well with that averaged from seismic reflection profiles. This result is the first 3-dimensional model in the UK with fully quantified uncertainties: it shows basin depths and basement structures, and their concomitant uncertainties.},

They share the favorable characteristics of random Monte Carlo over local optimization methods in that they do not require linearizing assumptions nor the calculation of partial derivatives, are independent of the misfit criterion, and avoid numerical instabilities associated with matrix inversion. The additional advantages over conventional methods such as iterative least squares is that the sampling is global, rather than local, thereby reducing the tendency to become entrapped in local minima and avoiding a dependency on an assumed starting model. In contrast to random Monte Carlo, however, they also share a desirable characteristic of the local methods in that they assimilate and take advantage of information collected during the sampling of the model space, resulting in an extremely efficient and robust optimization technique. This paper describes the basic genetic algorithm, briefly highlights some recent applications in the earth sciences and concludes that, in this field, the methodology should have many applications.}

  abstract = {The Otway Basin in southeast Australia contains a thick sequence of Cenozoic shelfal carbonates and siliciclastics that preserve signals relating to the progressive opening of the Southern Ocean since the Paleogene. This multidisciplinary study integrates outcrop and subsurface well data from over 100 wells and bores throughout the Otway Basin with micropalaeontological analyses to constrain the age and palaeoenvironments of the Nirranda Group (Late Eocene to Middle Oligocene) and the Heytesbury Group (Late Oligocene to mid Miocene). These data were used to deduce the Late Eocene to Late Oligocene palaeogeographical evolution of the area. During the Late Eocene paralic high energy siliciclastic shoreline to shelf facies dominated the region, deepening southwards where mid to outer shelf conditions preserved high energy sandy carbonate facies. Above the Eocene-Oligocene boundary low energy inner to mid shelfal silt and muddy sand persisted to the north, deepening southward to carbonate-dominated low energy outer shelf to bathyal marls. The change from siliciclastics to carbonates at the Eocene-Oligocene boundary in the Otway Basin may relate to regional tectonics. In the Early Oligocene, high energy inner to outer shelf sand bodies formed in front of marine to inner shelf mudstone facies; the sand units are likely to have been influenced by strong local longshore drift and ocean swells that increased as the Southern Ocean widened to create a larger fetch. In the eastern half of the basin, later in the Early Oligocene, mixed paralic to inner shelf siliciclastic and carbonate facies were deposited passing to inner to mid shelf marl and mudstone and outer shelf to bathyal marls basinward. During this time, low to high energy shelfal calcarenite, chalk and marl dominated the westerly edge of the basin. The contrast in facies from west and east in the basin is inferred to be due to contrasting terrigenous input, environmental energy and ramp/shelf geometry. By Late Oligocene times (the Clifton Formation) the Otway Basin was dominated by high energy carbonate facies deposited in mid to outer shelf palaeoenvironments. The base of the Clifton Formation preserves a shift in facies and foraminiferal faunas that correlates to the major sea level fall at the Early-Late Oligocene boundary. This sea level fall is related to a major ice advance in Antarctica that corresponds to mid-Oligocene unconformities globally. The switch from low to high energy facies across the Early-Late Oligocene boundary in the Otway Basin suggests that the Southern Ocean swells experienced by the modern Otway coast were well established by Middle Oligocene time, evidence of the strengthening "proto" Antarctic swell regime. By Early Miocene times, with final deepening of the Drake Passage, the Antarctic Circum-Polar Current formed and predominantly inner to outer shelf marls and limestones were deposited in the Otway Basin.},

The method uses Bayesian transdimensional Markov Chain Monte Carlo and allows us to specify a wide range of possible thermal history models to be considered as general prior information on time, temperature (and temperature offset for multiple samples in a vertical profile). We can also incorporate more focused geological constraints in terms of more specific priors. The Bayesian approach naturally prefers simpler thermal history models (which provide an adequate fit to the observations), and so reduces the problems associated with over interpretation of inferred thermal histories. The output of the method is a collection or ensemble of thermal histories, which quantifies the range of accepted models in terms a (posterior) probability distribution. Individual models, such as the best data fitting (maximum likelihood) model or the expected model (effectively the weighted mean from the posterior distribution) can be examined. Different data types (e.g., fission track, U-Th/He, 40Ar/39Ar) can be combined, requiring just a data-specific predictive forward model and data fit (likelihood) function. To demonstrate the main features and implementation of the approach, examples are presented using both synthetic and real data.},

The simulation tool is implemented in 2D Cartesian coordinates and first validated by comparison with analytical solutions for benchmark problems. It is then applied to surface explosions simulating meteor impacts on Mars in various Martian atmo-spheric conditions inferred from global climate models. The acoustic wave travel times are validated by comparison with 2D ray tracing in a windy atmosphere. Our simulations predict that acoustic waves generated by impacts can refract back to the surface on wind ducts at high altitude. In addition, due to the strong nighttime near-surface temperature gradient on Mars, the acoustic waves are trapped in a waveguide close to the surface, which allows a night-side detection of impacts at large distances in Mars plains. Such theoretical predictions are directly applicable to future measurements by the INSIGHT NASA Discovery mission.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY             Combining finite element methods for the incompressible Stokes equations with particle-in-cell methods is an important technique in computational geodynamics that has been widely applied in mantle convection, lithosphere dynamics and crustal-scale modelling. In these applications, particles are used to transport along properties of the medium such as the temperature, chemical compositions or other material properties; the particle methods are therefore used to reduce the advection equation to an ordinary differential equation for each particle, resulting in a problem that is simpler to solve than the original equation for which stabilization techniques are necessary to avoid oscillations.             On the other hand, replacing field-based descriptions by quantities only defined at the locations of particles introduces numerical errors. These errors have previously been investigated, but a complete understanding from both the theoretical and practical sides was so far lacking. In addition, we are not aware of systematic guidance regarding the question of how many particles one needs to choose per mesh cell to achieve a certain accuracy.             In this paper we modify two existing instantaneous benchmarks and present two new analytic benchmarks for time-dependent incompressible Stokes flow in order to compare the convergence rate and accuracy of various combinations of finite elements, particle advection and particle interpolation methods. Using these benchmarks, we find that in order to retain the optimal accuracy of the finite element formulation, one needs to use a sufficiently accurate particle interpolation algorithm. Additionally, we observe and explain that for our higher-order finite-element methods it is necessary to increase the number of particles per cell as the mesh resolution increases (i.e. as the grid cell size decreases) to avoid a reduction in convergence order.             Our methods and results allow designing new particle-in-cell methods with specific convergence rates, and also provide guidance for the choice of common building blocks and parameters such as the number of particles per cell. In addition, our new time-dependent benchmark provides a simple test that can be used to compare different implementations, algorithms and for the assessment of new numerical methods for particle interpolation and advection. We provide a reference implementation of this benchmark in aspect (the `Advanced Solver for Problems in Earth's ConvecTion'), an open source code for geodynamic modelling.},

  abstract = {Integrated surface--subsurface hydrological models (ISSHMs) are increasingly being used for the assessment of contaminant transport in the environment, in addition to their more common use in water flow applications. However, the subsurface solute transport solvers in these models are prone to numerical dispersion errors. Numerical dispersion is a well-known issue in groundwater modeling, but its impacts on the results of ISSHM simulations are still poorly understood. In this study, the CATchment HYdrology (CATHY) model is used to assess the potential impacts of numerical dispersion on the simulation of coupled surface--subsurface solute transport. We first simulate the subsurface transport of a nonreactive tracer in two soil column test cases (1D and 3D) with known analytical solutions. The subsurface solute transport solver in CATHY adopts a computationally efficient time-splitting technique whereby the advection component of the governing equation is solved on elements and the hydrodynamic dispersion component is solved on nodes. Comparison between simulation results and analytical solutions with different mesh discretizations and different values for the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficients allows for accurate quantification of the numerical dispersion error and yields insights into the parameters and other factors that control it. It is shown that, taken alone, the advection and dispersion solvers are very robust, but their combination can result in significant numerical dispersion, stemming from the ex\- change of concentration information from elements to nodes and vice versa in the time-splitting procedure. The tests also show that these errors can be kept under control by ensuring that the grid P{\textasciiacute}eclet number is in the range 0.5-1.0 or smaller. We then apply CATHY in a third test case involving two synthetic hillslopes (concave and convex) in fully coupled surface--subsurface mode, in order to examine the impact of this subsurface numerical dispersion on simulated streamflow hydrographs, in particular with reference to pre-event water contributions to runoff. Here as well the results show that the effect of numerical dispersion can be controlled by keeping the grid P{\textasciiacute}eclet number sufficiently small. This work provides a new set of benchmark test cases for integrated surfa\- ce--subsurface hydrological models, extending to solute transport the flow-only suite of benchmarks recently published in two intercomparison studies.},

  abstract = {We develop a 3-D finite-element model to study the viscoelastic response of a compressible Earth to surface loads. The effects of centre of mass motion, polar wander feedback, and selfconsistent ocean loading are implemented. To assess the model's accuracy, we benchmark the numerical results against a semi-analytic solution for spherically symmetric structure. We force our model with the ICE-5G global ice loading history to study the effects of laterally varying viscosity structure on several glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) observables, including relative sea-level (RSL) measurements in Canada, and present-day time-variable gravity and uplift rates in Antarctica. Canadian RSL observations have been used to determine the Earth's globally averaged viscosity profile. Antarctic GPS uplift rates have been used to constrain Antarctic GIA models. And GIA time-variable gravity and uplift signals are error sources for GRACE and altimeter estimates of present-day Antarctic ice mass loss, and must be modelled and removed from those estimates. Computing GIA results for a 3-D viscosity profile derived from a realistic seismic tomography model, and comparing with results computed for 1-D averages of that 3-D profile, we conclude that: (1) a GIA viscosity model based on Canadian relative sea-level data is more likely to represent a Canadian average than a true global average; (2) the effects of 3-D viscosity structure on GRACE estimates of present-day Antarctic mass loss are probably smaller than the difference between GIA models based on different Antarctic deglaciation histories and (3) the effects of 3-D viscosity structure on Antarctic GPS observations of present-day uplift rate can be significant, and can complicate efforts to use GPS observations to constrain 1-D GIA models.},

  abstract = {We have designed a 2D thermal--mechanical code, incorporating both a characteristics based marker-in-cell method and conservative finite-difference (FD) schemes. In this paper we will give a detailed description of this code. The temperature equation is advanced in time with the Lagrangian marker techniques based on the method of characteristics and the temperature solution is interpolated back to an Eulerian grid configuration at each timestep. This marker approach allows for the accurate portrayal of very fine thermal structures. For attaining a high relative accuracy in the solution of the matrix equations associated with both the momentum and temperature equations, we have employed the direct matrix inversion technique, which becomes feasible with the advent of very large shared-memory machines. Our conservative finite-difference schemes allow us to capture sharp variations of the stresses and thermal gradients in problems with a strongly variable viscosity and thermal conductivity. We have tested this code with numerous examples drawn from Rayleigh--Taylor instabilities, the descent of a stiff object into a medium with a lower viscosity, viscous heating and flows with non-Netwonian rheology. We have also benchmarked successfully with variable viscosity convection for lateral viscosity contrast up to 108. We have delineated the regions in thermal problems where the diffusive nature of the temperature equation changes from its parabolic character locally to a non-linear hyperbolic-like equation due to the presence of variable thermal conductivity. Finally we discuss the applicability of this marker-based and finite-difference technique to other evolutionary equations in geophysics.},

  abstract = {Scientific theories of how subduction and plate tectonics began on Earth--and what the tectonic structure of Earth was before this--remain enigmatic and contentious. Understanding viable scenarios for the onset of subduction and plate tectonics is hampered by the fact that subduction initiation processes must have been markedly different before the onset of global plate tectonics because most present-day subduction initiation mechanisms require acting plate forces and existing zones of lithospheric weakness, which are both consequences of plate tectonics. However, plume-induced subduction initiation could have started the first subduction zone without the help of plate tectonics. Here, we test this mechanism using high-resolution three-dimensional numerical thermomechanical modelling. We demonstrate that three key physical factors combine to trigger self-sustained subduction: (1) a strong, negatively buoyant oceanic lithosphere; (2) focused magmatic weakening and thinning of lithosphere above the plume; and (3) lubrication of the slab interface by hydrated crust. We also show that plume-induced subduction could only have been feasible in the hotter early Earth for old oceanic plates. In contrast, younger plates favoured episodic lithospheric drips rather than self-sustained subduction and global plate tectonics.},

  abstract = {The adjoint method is a powerful means to obtain gradient information in a mantle convection model relative to past flow structure. While the adjoint equations in geodynamics have been derived for the conservation equations of mantle flow in their incompressible form, the applicability of this approximation to Earth is limited, because density increases by almost a factor of two (Dziewonski and Anderson, Phys Earth Planet Inter 25:297--356, 1981) from the surface to the Core Mantle Boundary. Here we introduce the compressible adjoint equations for the conservation equations in the anelastic-liquid approximation. Our derivation applies an operator formulation in Hilbert spaces, to connect to recent work in seismology (Fichtner et al., Phys Earth Planet Inter 157(1--2):86--104, 2006b) and geodynamics (Horbach et al., Int J Geomath 5(2):163--194, 2014), where the approach was used to derive the adjoint equations for the wave equation and incompressible mantle flow. We present numerical tests of the newly derived equations based on twin experiments, focusing on three simulations. A first, termed Compressible, assumes the compressible forward and adjoint equations, and represents the consistent means of including compressibility effects. A second, termed Mixed, applies the compressible forward equation, but ignores compressibility effects in the adjoint equations, where the incompressible equations are used instead. A third simulation, termed Incompressible, neglects compressibility effects entirely in the forward and adjoint equations relative to the reference twin. The compressible and mixed formulations successfully restore earlier mantle flow structure, while the incompressible formulation yields noticeable artifacts. Our results suggest the use of a compressible formulation, when applying the adjoint method to seismically derived mantle heterogeneity structure.},

The ages (36-53 ka) determined from co-existing cosmogenic 21Ne and 3He in olivines separated from basalts are consistent within analytical uncertainties with ages previously determined by cosmogenic 36Cl exposure dating. This paper illustrates the potential of cosmogenic neon exposure ages in studying the eruption, surface morphology, and erosion history of young volcanic rocks, which are difficult to date using other conventional methods, such as K-Ar or 40Ar/39Ar dating. The present study demonstrates that combined cosmogenic 3He and 21Ne dating, specifically measured cosmogenic 3He/21Ne ratios, on the same samples, is powerful for evaluating the validity of calculated cosmogenic 3He and 21Ne surface exposure ages. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Spatially, the Tasmanides comprise five orogenic belts, with an internal Permian-Triassic rift-foreland basin system. Temporally, the Tasmanides comprise three (super)cycles, each encompassing relatively long periods of sedimentation and igneous activity, terminated by short deformational events. The Neoproterozoic-earliest Ordovician Delamerian cycle began by rifting, followed by convergent margin tectonism and accretion of island-arc forearc crust and ?island arcs in the Middle-Late Cambrian. The Ordovician-Carboniferous convergent margin Lachlan supercycle consists of three separate cycles, each ending in major deformation. The Ordovician Benambran cycle includes convergent (island-arc) and transform margin activity terminated by terrane accretion in the latest Ordovician-earliest Silurian. The Silurian-Middle Devonian Tabberabberan cycle reflects development of a large back-arc basin system, marked by rift basins and granite batholiths, behind intra-oceanic arcs and an Ordovician-Early Devonian terrane that were accreted in the Middle Devonian. The Middle Devonian to Carboniferous Kanimblan cycle began by rifting, followed by continental sedimentation inboard of a major convergent margin system that forms the early part of the Late Devonian-Traissic Hunter-Bowen supercycle. This supercycle comprises a Late Devonian-Carboniferous continental arc, forearc basin and outboard accreted terranes and subduction complexes intruded by the roots of a Permian-Triassic continental margin arc. Complex deformation ended with accretion of an intra-oceanic arc in the Early Triassic. Key features of the Tasmanides are: continuity of cycles across and along its length, precluding growth by simple eastwards accretion; development of a segmented plate margin in the Late Cambrian, reflected by major rollback of the proto-Pacific plate opposite the southern part of the Tasmanides; rifting of parts of the Delamerian margin oceanwards, to form substrate to outboard parts of the Tasmanides; the presence of five major Ordovician terranes in the Lachlan Orogen; and the generation of deformations either by the accretion of arcs, the largely orogen-parallel transpressive' accretion of Ordovician turbidite terranes (in the Lachlan Orogen), or by changes in plate coupling.}

Porphyry groups 1 -- 3 formed during critical events in the evolution of the arc related to interruptions and resumptions of arc activity.

In contrast, Group 4 porphyries are syn-accretionary and were emplaced into tilted and deformed volcanic and volcaniclastic packages during an extension or relaxation event in the multiphase Early Silurian Benambran Orogeny, attributed to the accretion of the arc and collapse of the former backarc basin. The Lachlan Transverse Zone is a major arc-normal corridor that favoured emplacement of many porphyries commonly, but not exclusively, shoshonitic in chemistry.

ASPECT (Advanced Solver for Problems in Earth's ConvecTion) is a massively parallel finite element code originally designed for modeling thermal convection in the mantle with a Newtonian rheology. The code is characterized by modern numerical methods, high-performance parallelism and extensibility. This last characteristic is illustrated in this work: we have extended the use of ASPECT from global thermal convection modeling to upper-mantle-scale applications of subduction. Subduction modeling generally requires the tracking of multiple materials with different properties and with nonlinear viscous and viscoplastic rheologies. To this end, we implemented a frictional plasticity criterion that is combined with a viscous diffusion and dislocation creep rheology. Because ASPECT uses compositional fields to represent different materials, all material parameters are made dependent on a user-specified number of fields. The goal of this paper is primarily to describe and verify our implementations of complex, multi-material rheology by reproducing the results of four well-known two-dimensional benchmarks: the indentor benchmark, the brick experiment, the sandbox experiment and the slab detachment benchmark. Furthermore, we aim to provide hands-on examples for prospective users by demonstrating the use of multi-material viscoplasticity with three-dimensional, thermomechanical models of oceanic subduction, putting ASPECT on the map as a community code for high-resolution, nonlinear rheology subduction modeling.}

  abstract = {Lithospheric drips have been interpreted for various regions around the globe to account for the recycling of the continental lithosphere and rapid plateau uplift. However, the validity of such hypothesis is not well documented in the context of geological, geophysical and petrological observations that are tested against geodynamical models. Here we propose that the folding of the Central Anatolian (K{\i}r{\c s}ehir) arc led to thickening of the lithosphere and onset of ``dripping'' of the arc root. Our geodynamic model explains the seismic data showing missing lithosphere and a remnant structure characteristic of a dripping arc root, as well as enigmatic {\textbackslash}textgreater1 km uplift over the entire plateau, Cappadocia and Galatia volcanism at the southern and northern plateau margins since {$\sim$}10 Ma, respectively. Models show that arc root removal yields initial surface subsidence that inverts {\textbackslash}textgreater1 km of uplift as the vertical loading and crustal deformation change during drip evolution.}

  abstract = {Understanding rock deformation processes in solid Earth materials, from the crystal to the tectonic plate scale, is essential for characterising the evolution of the lithosphere and for predicting how rocks behave in the subsurface. Temperature is a key parameter that determines what rock deformation processes are active and therefore how tectonic structures form. Moreover, it controls the migration of fluids and melt in the Earth's crust that lead to phase transformations and changes in rock rheology. This special issue gathers a collection of research papers following the 21st International Conference on Deformation Mechanisms, Rheology and Tectonics (DRT-2017), which was held in Inverness (Scotland) in April--May 2017, organised by the University of Aberdeen. These contributions provide a significant advance in the study of rock deformation and fluid/melt migration at multiple crustal levels, from deformation bands near the Earth's surface to shear zones in partially molten rocks in the lower crust. In this introductory article, we first provide an overview of how temperature controls deformation mechanisms and processes and then introduce the collection of research papers ordered from those analysing deformation processes occurring at high temperatures to contributions reporting deformation at shallow crustal conditions.},

  abstract = {Detailed regional body wave tomographic inversion of the Western Pacific region has been performed using P and S travel times from common sources and receivers, with a joint inversion in terms of bulk-sound and shear wave-speed variations in the mantle. This technique allows the separation of the influence of bulk and shear moduli, and hence a more direct comparison with mineral physics information. The study region is parameterized with cells of side 0.5{$^\circ$} to 2{$^\circ$} and 19 layers to a depth of 1500 km, while the rest of the mantle was parameterized with 5{\texttimes}5{$^\circ$} cells with 16 layers between the surface and the core-mantle boundary. A simultaneous inversion is made for regional and global structures to minimize the influence of surrounding structures on the regional image. A nested iterative inversion scheme is employed with local linearization and three-dimensional ray tracing through the successive model updates. The results of the regional tomographic inversion reveal the penetration of a subducted slab below the 660 km discontinuity at the Kurile-Kamchatka trench, while flattening of slabs above this depth is observed in the Japan and Izu-Bonin subduction zones on both the bulk-sound and shear wave-speed images. The penetration of a subducted slab down to a depth of at least 1200 km is seen below the southern part of the Bonin trench, Mariana, Philippine, and Java subduction zones. Fast shear wave-speed perturbations associated with the subducted slabs, down to the 410 km transition zone, are larger than the comparable bulk-sound perturbations for all these subduction zones except the Philippines. The bulk-sound signature for the subducted slab is more pronounced than for shear in the Philippines, Talaud, New Guinea, Solomon, and Tonga subduction zones, where penetration of the slab into the middle mantle is observed. Variation in the amplitude ratio between bulk-sound and shear wave-speed anomalies correlates well with the subduction parameters of the descending slab. Slabs younger than 90 Ma at the trench show bulk-sound dominance in the upper mantle, while older slabs have a stronger shear wave-speed signature. Spreading of the fast shear wave-speed zone between 800 and 1000 km is observed in the areas of deep subducted slab penetration, but has no comparable expression in the bulk-sound images. This high-velocity feature may reflect physical or chemical disequilibria introduced to the lower mantle by subducted slabs. {\copyright} 2003. Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Intraplate continental magmatism represents a fundamental mechanism in Earth's magmatic, thermal, chemical and environmental evolution. It is a process intimately linked with crustal development, large-igneous provinces, metallogeny and major global environmental catastrophes. As a result, understanding the interactions of continental magmas through time is vital in understanding their effect on the planet. The interaction of mantle plumes with the lithosphere has been shown to significantly affect the location and form of continental magmatism, but only at modern mantle conditions. In this study, we perform numerical modelling for Late Archean (1600 {$^\circ$}C), Paleoproterozoic (1550 {$^\circ$}C), Meso-Neoproteroic (1500 {$^\circ$}C) and Phanerozoic (1450 {$^\circ$}C) mantle potential temperatures (Tp) to assess the time-space magmatic effects of ambient-mantle- and plume- lithosphere interaction over Earth's thermal history. Within these experiments, we impinge a mantle plume, with a time-appropriate Tp, onto a 'step-like' lithosphere, to evaluate the effect of craton margins on continental magmatism through time. The results of this modelling demonstrate that lithospheric architecture controls the volume and location of continental magmatism throughout Earth history, irrespective of ambient mantle or plume Tp. In all plume models, mantle starting plumes (diameter 300 km) impinge on the base of the lithosphere, and spread laterally over {\textbackslash}textgreater 1600 km, flowing into the shallowest mantle, and producing the highest volume magmas. In ambient-mantle only models, Archean and Paleoproterozoic Tp values yield significant sub-lithospheric melt volumes, resulting in `passive' geodynamic emplacement of basaltic magmatic provinces, whereas no melts are extracted at {\textbackslash}textgreater 100 km for Meso-Neoproterozoic and Phanerozoic Tp. This indicates a major transition in non-subduction related continental magmatism from plume and ambient mantle to a plume-dominated source around the Mesoproterozoic. While the experiments presented here show the variation in plume-lithosphere interaction through time, the consistency in melt localisation indicates the lithosphere has been a first-order control on continental magmatism since its establishment in the Mesoarchean.},

  abstract = {The Earth's topography is shaped by surface processes that operate on various scales. In particular, river processes control landscape dynamics over large length scales, whereas hillslope processes control the dynamics over smaller length scales. This scale separation challenges numerical treatments of landscape evolution that use space discretization. Large grid spacing cannot account for the dynamics of water divides that control drainage area competition, and erosion rate and slope distribution. Small grid spacing that properly accounts for divide dynamics is computationally inefficient when studying large domains. Here we propose a new approach for landscape evolution modeling that couples irregular grid-based numerical solutions for the large-scale fluvial dynamics and continuum-based analytical solutions for the small-scale fluvial and hillslope dynamics. The new approach is implemented in the landscape evolution model DAC (divide and capture). The geometrical and topological characteristics of DAC's landscapes show compatibility with those of natural landscapes. A comparative study shows that, even with large grid spacing, DAC predictions fit well an analytical solution for divide migration in the presence of horizontal advection of topography. In addition, DAC is used to study some outstanding problems in landscape evolution. (i) The time to steady-state is investigated and simulations show that steady-state requires much more time to achieve than predicted by fixed area calculations, due to divides migration and persistent reorganization of low-order streams. (ii) Large-scale stream captures in a strike-slip environment are studied and show a distinct pattern of erosion rates that can be used to identify recent capture events. (iii) Three tectono-climatic mechanisms that can lead to asymmetric mountains are studied. Each of the mechanisms produces a distinct morphology and erosion rate distribution. Application to the Southern Alps of New Zealand suggests that tectonic advection, precipitation gradients and non-uniform tectonic uplift act together to shape the first-order topography of this mountain range. {\copyright} 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The method is especially designed for concurrent processing and interpretation in an interactive mode.The effect on gravity of a homogeneous polyhedron is calculated by transforming a volume integral into a sum of line integrals. Magnetic effects can be modeled by using either Poisson's theorem or a slight modification of the formulas derived for gravity modeling. The interactive modeling program allows the user to change the geometry as well as the density and/or susceptibility of the elementary polyhedra and to observe results quickly during the course of processing. This capability enables the interpreter to decide immediately if and where a tentative geologic structure must be changed for the modeled effect to fit that of a field survey. He is able to drive the device-dependent process by clear menu functions without any knowledge of the rather complicated data structure and the interaction between the main program and its many subroutines. In addition, application of this method requires considerably less computing time than conventional methods based on the direct evaluation of volume integrals.},

  abstract = {Because global coverage of heat flow measurements is still poor in many areas, empirical estimators based on the geology, the thermotectonic age or the velocity structure of the upper mantle have often been used to affect an estimate to regions where such measurements are absent. On the basis of the assumption that heat flow is strongly related to its geodynamic environment, one may integrate multiple proxies derived from a large body of global geological and geophysical data sets assembled during the past decades; these should help to better capture the variety of present-day settings. This idea is illustrated through two simple empirical methods: both of them are based on a set of examples, where heat flow measurements are associated with relevant terrestrial observables such as surface heat production, upper-mantle velocity structure, tectono-thermal age, on a 1{$^\circ\times$} 1{$^\circ$} grid. To a given target point owning a number of observables, the methods associate a heat flow distribution rather than a deterministic value to account for intrinsic variability and uncertainty within a defined geodynamic environment. The `best combination method' seeks the particular combination of observables that minimizes the dispersion of the heat flow distribution generated from the set of examples. The `similarity method' attributes a weight to each example depending on its degree of similarity with the target point. The methods are transparent and are able to handle sets of observables that are not available over the whole Earth (e.g. heat production). The resulting trends of the mean heat flow deduced from the two methods do not differ strongly, but the similarity method shows a better accuracy in cross-validation tests. These tests suggest that the selected proxies have the potential to recover at least partly medium- to large-scale features of surface heat flow. The methods depict the main global trends of low heat flow in stable and ancient regions, and thermal high in active orogens and rift zones. Broad thermal anomalies are outlined in the Sahara and in the tectonically active eastern part of Antarctica. The similarity method estimates a continental heat loss of 13.6 {\textpm} 0.8 TW (2{$\sigma$} uncertainty), which is consistent with previous estimates.},

  abstract = {Recent megathrust events in Tohoku (Japan), Maule (Chile), and Sumatra (Indonesia) were well recorded. Much has been learned about the dominant physical processes in megathrust zones: (partial) locking of the plate interface, detailed coseismic slip, relocking, afterslip, viscoelastic mantle relaxation, and interseismic loading. These and older observations show complex spatial and temporal patterns in crustal deformation and displacement, and significant differences among different margins. A key question is whether these differences reflect variations in the underlying processes, like differences in locking, or the margin geometry, or whether they are a consequence of the stage in the earthquake cycle of the margin. Quantitative models can connect these plate boundary processes to surficial and far-field observations. We use relatively simple, cyclic geodynamic models to isolate the first-order geodetic signature of the megathrust cycle. Coseismic and subsequent slip on the subduction interface is dynamically (and consistently) driven. A review of global preseismic, coseismic, and postseismic geodetic observations, and of their fit to the model predictions, indicates that similar physical processes are active at different margins. Most of the observed variability between the individual margins appears to be controlled by their different stages in the earthquake cycle. The modeling results also provide a possible explanation for observations of tensile faulting aftershocks and tensile cracking of the overriding plate, which are puzzling in the context of convergence/compression. From the inversion of our synthetic GNSS velocities we find that geodetic observations may incorrectly suggest weak locking of some margins, for example, the west Aleutian margin.},

  abstract = {From 1998 May to September a portable array of 40 short-period digital seismograph stations was operated in western Victoria, southeast Australia, across the western end of the mid- Paleozoic Lachlan Foldbelt and the Newer Volcanic Province. Consisting of four parallel, almost W--E-oriented receiver lines, the array covered an area of about 270 {\texttimes} 150 km2. The major aim of the LF98 (Lachlan Foldbelt survey 1998) project is to map lateral variations in P-wave speeds (Vp) in the crust and upper mantle using teleseismic arrival time tomography, primarily in order to investigate whether the major surface structural zones are associated with seismic velocity signatures at depth. Little a priori information from seismic profiling is available.We invert 4067 relative arrival time residuals for a minimum structure Vp model in the upper few hundred km using non-linear iteration and 3-D ray tracing. The most prominent negative anomaly ({$\sim$}3.8 per cent) in Vp is found at a depth of about 45 km underneath the eastern part of the Newer Volcanic Province. It correlates spatially with the highest density of Pliocene and Pleistocene eruption centres northwest of Melbourne, and is therefore interpreted as a hotspot-related high-temperature anomaly causing reduced mantle velocities. The related coherent volume of significantly lower than average velocities extends down to depths greater than 100 km in the east, and extends west underneath the Newer Volcanic Province. A strong velocity contrast, with average velocities {$\sim$}2 per cent greater in the west, is found down to about 100 km across the Moyston Fault Zone, which forms the major structural boundary between the early-Paleozoic Delamerian Orogen in the west and the Lachlan Orogen in the east. This result suggests that the Moyston Fault Zone should be seen as a major lithospheric boundary. In the south this boundary is also expressed by a distinct discontinuity in Sr-isotopic ratios of xenoliths (the so-called Mortlake discontinuity) and a change in the geochemistry of plutons of similar age. However, if the east to west velocity contrast originally existed in this southern zone, it is now overprinted by the thermally reduced mantle velocities beneath the Newer Volcanic Province.},

  abstract = {The largest component of the basaltic Newer Volcanic Province of Victoria, Australia, the Western Plains subprovince, comprises extensive tholeiitic to alkalic lava flows and pyroclastics. The subprovince is subdivided into eastern and western sectors with distinctive Sr isotopic signatures; the isotopic discontinuity corresponds to an underlying Paleozoic tectonic boundary. Fifty-one new K--Ar ages plus previously published results encompass the geographic, lithological and isotopic variants of the subprovince, and are used to date extensive flow units, provide time calibration of regolith mapping units, and to compile eruptive and petrogenetic histories. The onset of volcanism at 4.6 Ma, the peak of activity at 3.0--1.8 Ma, and the progression from tholeiitic to alkalic compositions towards the present day are subprovince-wide, indicating that the basis of activity is independent of the lithospheric substrate. Local activity appears to have little pattern: some subareas have a conservative aspect, eruptin...},

  abstract = {Studies of inverted basins solely on the preserved section provide only partial insight into the thermal and tectonic history of basin development. Equally important is that part of the history represented by section removed by erosion during inversion. Thermal History Reconstruction, involving application of Apatite Fission Track Analysis (AFTA) and Vitrinite Reflectance (VR) to define the timing and magnitude of key erosional and/or thermal episodes, and integration of this information with data from the preserved section, provides a more complete description. Case histories from the UK, New Zealand and Australia are presented to demonstrate this approach. Much of northern and eastern England, the Irish Sea and the southern North Sea was affected by heating apparently due largely to additional burial, followed by early Tertiary cooling due to regional uplift and erosion, synchronous with recognized basin inversion events. Heating associated with this episode caused generation of hydrocarbons throughout the region. Areas conventionally regarded as not inverted appear to have been subjected to km-scale uplift and erosion, which was not restricted to classic 'inversion axes'. Failure to allow for these effects can lead to a significant underestimation of regional maturity trends. Thermal History Reconstruction is also essential in areas that have undergone more than one episode of inversion. For example in Inner Moray Firth well 12/16-1 maximum palaeotemperatures in the Carboniferous section were reached prior to Hercynian inversion and the chances of preserving any hydrocarbons generated from Carboniferous or older source rocks appear poor. In southeastern Australia, early Cretaceous rift basins underwent mid-Cretaceous inversion at a time of high palaeogeothermal gradients (c. 60 degrees C km (super -1) ), and basement margins were also inverted at that time. Again, early generation implies that the chances of preservation of hydrocarbons are small. By integrating stratigraphic and structural relationships within the preserved section with data on the palaeo-thermal history of a section derived from direct measurements of palaeotemperature profiles, the complete history of hydrocarbon generation may be reconstructed with confidence.},

  abstract = {Water transported within the subducting oceanic lithosphere into the Earth's interior affects a wealth of subduction zone processes, including intraslab earthquakes and arc magmatism. In recent years growing evidence suggests that much of the hydration of oceanic plates occurs at the trench-ocean slope right before subduction. Here, normal faults are created while the rigid lithosphere bends into the trench. Offshore of Middle America, multi-channel seismic reflection imaging suggests that bending-related faults cut into the uppermost mantle, providing a mechanism for hydration and transformation of mantle peridotites into serpentinites. Seismic wide-angle reflection and refraction data were collected coincident with one of the seismic profiles where the faults have been imaged. Travel time inversion provides evidence that both crustal and uppermost mantle velocities are reduced with respect to the velocity structure found in mature oceanic crust away from deep-sea trenches. If mantle velocity reduction is solely produced by hydration, velocities indicate 10-15\% of serpentinization in the uppermost 3 km of the mantle, where seismic data provide enough resolution. A small network of ocean bottom hydrophones, deployed for about a month, detected {$\sim$} 3 local micro earthquakes per day. Earthquake epicentres align with fault scarps at the seafloor and continuous earthquake activity might be an important process to facilitate the percolation of seawater into the upper mantle. {\copyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Granulite-facies xenoliths, interpreted as lower-crustal material, have been found at more than 40 of these localities. A palaeogeotherm, based on garnet pyroxenite xenoliths from Victoria, also fits available data from New South Wales and Queensland. A crustal thickness of 25--30 km, and lower-crustal temperatures of 700-850\{degrees\}C, have been derived by referring T estimates for spinel lherzolite xenoliths to this geotherm. The lower-crustal xenolith suites are dominated by basic pyroxene granulites and garnet granulites; more silicic xenoliths are very rarely reported. The granulites cover a range in composition typical of intraplate basaltic magmas and cumulates. Granoblastic microstructures are typical, but common relict igneous features suggest that all the mafic granulites originated as igneous rocks. The lower crust in this area probably formed through multiple intrusion of basic magmas near the crust/mantle interface over a long time span. The strongly layered lower crust' seen on seismic reflection studies in eastern Australia probably represents this thick crust-mantle transition zone. The seismic Moho' reflects the depth at which the proportion of basic to ultrabasic rocks drops below a critical value, and probably lies well below the petrographically defined base of the crust.}

  abstract = {In a previous study of the effects of cooling and solidification  on  flows issuing onto a  horizontal plane and spreading under gravity we considered the case of   a viscous fluid  that solidifies to form a thin surface crust with a finite yield strength.   In that case, the  coupling of solidification and viscous stresses in the flow led to  a sequence of flow  regimes or styles of flow and crustal deformation. Here, we study  the spreading, from  a small source, of a plastic material having a yield strength before  cooling. In this case  the fluid again begins to freeze as it spreads radially under  gravity, and forms a dome  having a surface crust which is stronger than the extruded fluid.  If cooling is sufficiently  rapid compared to gravity-driven spreading, the flow is found to be controlled  by  solidification. The flow again takes on one of a number of flow regimes  depending on  the pace of solidification relative to the rate of lateral flow, or extrusion  rate.  However, these flow regimes are quite different from those  for the viscous extrusions,  implying that the internal yield stress has a strong influence on  the behaviour. Styles  of flow ranged from inflation of an axisymmetric dome to irregular  extrusion of lateral  lobes and vertical spines. These qualitatively different regimes have much  in common  with the eruption styles of volcanic lava domes produced by effusion of  extremely  viscous silicic magmas which may possess a yield strength, and the model  provides  information about the factors influencing the morphology and hazards of  such  volcanic flows.},

In this contribution we introduce LoopStructural, a new open-source 3D geological modelling Python package (http://www.github.com/Loop3d/LoopStructural, last access: 15~June~2021). LoopStructural provides a generic API for 3D geological modelling applications harnessing the core Python scientific libraries pandas, numpy and scipy. Six different interpolation algorithms, including three discrete interpolators and 3 polynomial trend interpolators, can be used from the same model design. This means that different interpolation algorithms can be mixed and matched within a geological model allowing for different geological objects, e.g.~different conformable foliations, fault surfaces and unconformities to be modelled using different algorithms. Geological features are incorporated into the model using a time-aware approach, where the most recent features are modelled first and used to constrain the geometries of the older features. For example, we use a fault frame for characterising the geometry of the fault surface and apply each fault sequentially to the faulted surfaces. In this contribution we use LoopStructural to produce synthetic proof of concepts models and a 86\,km\,{\texttimes}\,52\,km model of the Flinders Ranges in South Australia using map2loop.},

  abstract = {Seafloor spreading and the cooling of oceanic lithosphere is a fundamental feature of plate tectonics in the Earth, the details of which are unveiled by modeling with constraints from mineral physics and geophysical observations. To work toward a more complete model of the thermal evolution of oceanic lithosphere, we investigate the contributions of axial hydrothermal circulation, oceanic crust, and temperature-pressure-dependent thermal properties. We find that models with only temperature-dependent properties disagree with geophysical observations unless properties are artificially modified. On the other hand, more comprehensive models are in better agreement with geophysical observations. Our preferred model requires a thermal expansivity reduction of 15\% from a mineral physics estimate, and predicts a plate thickness of about 110--130 km. A principal result of our analysis is that the oceanic crust is a major contributor to the cooling of oceanic lithosphere. The oceanic crust acts as an insulating lid on the mantle, causing the rate of lithospheric cooling to increase from ``crustal'' values near the ridge to higher mantle values at old-age. Major consequences of this insulation effect are: (a) low seafloor subsidence rate in proximity to ridge axes ({\textbackslash}textless5 Ma), (b) the thermal structure of oceanic lithosphere is significantly warmer than previous models, (c) seafloor heat flow is significantly lower over young ({\textbackslash}textless35 Ma) seafloor compared to simple models, (d) a low net seafloor heat flux ({$\sim$}27 TW), and (e) temperature at the base of the seismogenic zone extends to 700--800{$^\circ$}C mantle.},

Here we have investigated the protective effects of the intramuscular application of the Hc-TeTx on motor asymmetry and neurodegeneration in the striatum of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-treated rats. Adult male rats were intramuscularly injected with the recombinant Hc-TeTx protein (0.1-20{$\mu$}g/kg, daily) 3days before the stereotaxic injection of 6-OHDA into the left striatum. Our results showed that the motor-improvement functions were extended for 4weeks in all Hc-TeTx-treated groups, obtaining the maximum performance with the highest dose of Hc-TeTx (20{$\mu$}g/kg). The improvements found were 97\%, 87\%, and 70\% in the turning behavior, stepping test, and cylinder test, respectively. The striatal levels of dopamine and its metabolites did not vary compared to the control group. Moreover, the peripheral treatment with Hc-TeTx in rats prevents, for 30days, the neurodegeneration in the striatum caused by the toxicity of the 6-OHDA. Our results lead us to believe that the Hc-TeTx could be a potential therapeutic agent in pathologies caused by impairment of dopaminergic innervations such as Parkinson's disease. {\copyright} 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd and the Japan Neuroscience Society.},

  abstract = {Recent seismological observations suggest the existence of a {$\approx$}150-km-thick density-stratified layer with a P-wave velocity gradient that differs slightly from PREM. Such a structure can only be caused by a compositional gradient, effects of a slurry or temperature being too small and probably the wrong sign. We propose a stably stratified, variable concentration layer on the liquidus. Heat is transported by conduction down the liquidus while the light and heavy components migrate through the layer by a process akin to zone refining, similar to the one originally proposed by Braginsky. The layer remains static in a frame of reference moving upwards with the expanding inner core boundary. We determine the gradient using estimates of co, the concentration in the main body of the outer core, and cb, the concentration of the liquid at the inner core boundary. We determine the depression of the melting point and concentrations using ideal solution theory and seismologically determined density jumps at the inner core boundary. We suppose that co determines {$\rho$} mod, the jump from normal mode eigenfrequencies that have long resolution lengths straddling the entire layer, and that cb determines {$\rho$} bod, the jump determined from body waves, which have fine resolution. A simple calculation then yields the seismic, temperature, and concentration profiles within the layer. Comparison with the distance to the C-cusp of PKP and normal mode eigenfrequencies constrain the model. We explore a wide range of possible input parameters; many fail to predict sensible seismic properties and heat fluxes. A model with {$\rho$} mod = 0.8 gm cc-1, {$\rho$} bod = 0.6 gm cc-1, and layer thickness 200 km is consistent with the seismic observations and can power the geodynamo with a reasonable inner core heat flux of {$\approx$}2 TW and nominal inner core age of {$\approx$}1 Ga. It is quite remarkable and encouraging that a model based on direct seismic observations and simple chemistry can predict heat fluxes that are comparable with those derived from recent core thermal history calculations. The model also provides plausible explanations of the observed seismic layer and accounts for the discrepancy between estimates of the inner core density jumps derived from body waves and normal modes.},

  abstract = {Contrasting results on the magnitude of the dynamic component of topography motivate us to analyse the sources of uncertainties affecting long wavelength topography modelling. We obtain a range of mantle density structures from thermo-chemical interpretation of available seismic tomography models. We account for pressure, temperature and compositional effects as inferred by mineral physics to relate seismic velocity with density. Mantle density models are coupled to crustal density distributions obtained with a similar methodology. We compute isostatic topography and associated residual topography maps and perform instantaneous mantle flow modelling to calculate the dynamic topography. We explore the effects of proposed mantle 1-D viscosities and also test a 3D pressure- and temperature-dependent viscosity model. We find that the patterns of residual and dynamic topography are robust, with an average correlation coefficient (r) of respectively {$\sim$}0.74 and {$\sim$}0.71, upper-lower quartile ranges of 0.86--0.65 for residual topography and 0.83--0.62 for dynamic topography maps. The amplitudes are, on the contrary, poorly constrained. For the static component, the inferred density models of lithospheric mantle give an interquartile range of isostatic topography that is always higher than 100 m, reaching 1.7 km in some locations, and averaging {$\sim$}720 m. Crustal density models satisfying the same compressional velocity structure lead to variations in isostatic topography averaging 350 m, with peaks of 1 km in thick crustal regions, and always higher than 100 m. The uncertainties on isostatic topography are strong enough to mask, if present, the contribution of mantle convection to surface topography. For the dynamic component, we obtain a peak-to-peak dynamic topography amplitude exceeding 3 km for all our mantle density and viscosity models. These extremely high values would be associated with a magnitude of geoid undulations that is not in agreement with observations. Considering chemical heterogeneities in correspondence with the lower mantle Large Low Shear wave Velocity Provinces (LLSVPs) helps to decrease the peak-to-peak amplitudes of dynamic topography and geoid, but significantly reduces the correlation between synthetic and observed geoid. The correlation coefficients between all our residual and dynamic topography maps (a total of 220 and 198, respectively) is {\textbackslash}textless0.55 (average = {$\sim$}0.19). The correlation slightly improves when considering only the very long-wavelength components of the maps (average = {$\sim$}0.23). We therefore conclude that a robust determination of dynamic topography is not feasible since current uncertainties affecting crustal density, mantle density and mantle viscosity are still too large. A truly interdisciplinary approach, combining constraints from the geological record with a multi-methodological interpretation of geophysical observations, is required to tackle the challenging task of linking the surface topography to deep processes.},

  abstract = {Heat flow and heat production data provide strong constraints on the composition and evolution of the continental crust. Four new heat flow and heat production data from the Grenville Province in Canada are presented and included in local and regional analyses of heat flow variations. Thirty heat flow data are now available in the Late Proterozoic Grenville Province, where the mean heat flow (41 {\textpm} 11 mW {$\cdot$} m-2) does not differ from that in the Archean Superior Province (41 {\textpm} 9 mW {$\cdot$} m-2). It is shown that varying crustal heat production or heat refraction effects account for most local heat flow variations. The average crustal heat production is lower than in the other Late Proterozoic provinces because the tectonic evolution of the Grenville promoted the emplacement of large mafic bodies. Statistical analyses of heat flow and heat production data in the Grenville Province, in the surrounding provinces (Canadian Appalachians and Superior Province) and in the Norwegian Shield indicate that, within each province, the range of heat flow and heat production variations attains 40 mW {$\cdot$} m-2 and 2 {$\mu$}W {$\cdot$} m-3 respectively. However, the patterns on the histograms are distinctive and are shown to be regulated by the vertical distribution of heat production. Crustal structure and composition of the Grenville Province and the Norwegian Shield account for similarities and differences in the heat flow and heat production patterns of the two areas. Mantle heat flow in the Grenville Province lies between 9 and 16 mW {$\cdot$} m-2, as in the Superior Province and in the Norwegian Shield.}

Built upon the observed velocity anomalies, we propose a sub-lithosphere mantle convection model for NE China in which the upwelling of upper mantle materials from the mantle transition zone to the Changbaishan volcano could induce a local sub-lithosphere convection in the upper mantle and the strong high velocity of the upper mantle beneath the Songliao Basin corresponds to the downwelling limb of this convection cell. The downwelling beneath the Songliao Basin could also induce secondary local convection in the asthenosphere to the west, leading to local asthenospheric upwelling beneath the Abaga and Halaha volcanoes in the Xing'an-Mongolia Orogenic Belt.},

Beneath the AustralianAntarctic Discordance, tomographic inversions show a northsouth-trending seismic anomaly with a higher than average shear velocity in the lower mantle and a prominent, nearly circular, high-velocity anomaly within the transition zone. These seismic inversions are consistent with the predictions of three-dimensional models of mantle convection with imposed plate tectonics. However, these earlier models, incorporating only a thermal slab, resulted in a circular topographic depression on the present South East Indian Ridge and are inconsistent with the observed residual depth anomaly which is continuous from the South East Indian Ridge nearly to the Australian and Antarctic margins. To resolve this discrepancy, we propose that the AustralianAntarctic Discordance results from the sampling of both an ancient mantle wedge, depleted by prolonged melting, and mantle cooled by the subduction system. Dynamic models show that the new ridge forming between Australia and Antarctica would have sampled the wedge first, resulting in a Vshaped structure, which matches the observed residual depth anomaly. The models show that the South East Indian Ridge would later sample the cool mantle which became trapped within the transition zone at 20 Ma, consistent with the observed increase in fracture zone density at the AustralianAntarctic Discordance in the Neogene.We propose that along the trace of the residual depth anomaly, a fundamental change occurred in the dominant mechanism causing the topography, first by sampling of refractory mantle from the old wedge and later by the sampling of cold mantle. This hypothesis can be tested with ocean floor recovered from drillholes along the depth anomaly.},

Mechanisms for emplacing offshore groundwater include glacial processes that drove water into exposed continental shelves during sea-level low stands and active connections to onshore hydrologic systems. While low-salinity groundwater is thought to be abundant, its distribution and volume worldwide is poorly understood due to the limited number of observations. Here we image laterally continuous aquifers extending 90 km offshore New Jersey and Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, on the U.S. Atlantic margin using new shallow water electromagnetic geophysical methods. Our data provide more continuous constraints on offshore groundwater than previous models and present evidence for a connection between the modern onshore hydrologic system and offshore aquifers. We identify clinoforms as a previously unknown structural control on the lateral extent of low-salinity groundwater and potentially a control on where low-salinity water rises into the seafloor. Our data suggest a continuous submarine aquifer system spans at least 350 km of the U.S. Atlantic coast and contains about 2800 km3 of low-salinity groundwater. Our findings can be used to improve models of past glacial, eustatic, tectonic, and geomorphic processes on continental shelves and provide insight into shelf geochemistry, biogeochemical cycles, and the deep biosphere.},

We analyzed the differential flow stress during the mylonitization of quartzofeldspathic rocks in the Whipple Mountains, California, using grain-size piezometers and kinetic laws for grain growth. Mylonitic gneisses collected from two widely separated transects have grain sizes that cluster in a range from 32 to 61-mu-m. Analysis of grain growth kinetics indicates that mylonitization of the gneisses continued during cooling to temperatures less-than-or-equal-to 500-degrees-C, compatible with estimates from two-feldspar thermometry. Quartz grain-size piezometers suggest that the mylonitization occurred under differential stresses (sigma-1-sigma-3) Of approximately 40-150 MPa, or maximum shear stresses of 20-75 MPa. Extrapolation of quartzite flow laws to 500-degrees-C indicates that the mylonitization occurred at strain rates faster than 10(-14) s-1. These estimates suggest that the mylonitic zone within the Whipple Mountains had an effective viscosity of the order of 10(18 +/- 14)-10(20 +/- 4) Pa s. These low viscosities and rapid strain rates, combined with seismic reflection data showing that continental crust is layered, suggest that more realistic physical models of extension of the continental lithosphere should treat the lithosphere as a heterogeneous distribution of high-viscosity regions separated by low- viscosity zones.},

  abstract = {Cooling and thickening of lithospheric plates with age and subduction result in large-scale horizontal density contrasts tending to drive plate motions and mantle flow. We quantify the driving forces associated with these density contrasts to determine if they can drive the observed plate motions. First, two-dimensional models are computed to evaluate the effects of assumed rheologies and boundary conditions. We are unable to obtain platelike behavior in viscous models with traction-free boundary conditions. The piecewise uniform velocities distinctive of plate motion can be imposed as boundary conditions and the dynamic consistency of the models evaluated by determining if the net force on each vanishes. If the lithosphere has a Newtonian viscous rheology, the net force on any plate is a strong function of the effective grid spacing used, leading to ambiguities in interpretation. Incorporating a rigid-plastic lithosphere, which fails at a critical yield stress, into the otherwise viscous model removes these ambiguities. The model is extended to the actual three-dimensional (spherical) plate geometry. The observed velocities of rigid-plastic plates are matched to the solution of the viscous Stokes equation at the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary. Body forces from the seismically observed slabs, from the thickening of the lithosphere obtained from the actual lithospheric ages, and from the differences in structure between continents and oceans are included. Interior density contrasts such as those resulting from upwellings from a hot bottom boundary layer are assumed to occur on a scale small compared to plate dimensions and are not included. The driving forces from the density contrasts within the plates are calculated and compared to resisting forces resulting from viscous drag computed from the three-dimensional global return flow and resistance to deformation at converging boundaries; the rms residual torque is {$\sim$}30\% of the driving torque. The density contrasts within the plates themselves can reasonably account for plate motions. Body forces from convection in the interior may provide only a small net force on the plates. At converging boundaries the lithosphere has a yield stress of {$\sim$}100 bars; drag at the base of the plates is {$\sim$}5 bars and resists plate motion. The net driving forces from subducting slabs and collisional resistance are localized and approximately balance. Driving forces from lithospheric thickening are distributed over the areas of the plates, as is viscous drag. The approximate balance of these two forces predicts plate velocities uncorrelated with plate area, as observed. The model represents a specific case of boundary layer convection; the dynamical results are consistent with either upper mantle or mantle-wide convection.},

GPS measurements and present seismicity illustrate the high rates of motions and tectonic complexity of the region, but provide little help in longterm reconstruction. Plate boundaries shifted rapidly in the Cenozoic. During convergence of the major plates, there were numerous important episodes of extension, forming ocean basins and causing subsidence within continental regions, probably driven by subduction. Within eastern Indonesia, New Guinea and the Melanesian arcs, there are multiple Cenozoic sutures, with very short histories compared to most well-known older orogenic belts. They preserve a record of major changes in tectonics, including subduction polarity reversals, elimination of volcanic arcs, changing plate boundaries and extension within an overall contractional setting. Rapid tectonic changes have occurred within periods of less than 5 Ma. Many events would be overlooked or ignored in older orogenic belts, even when evidence is preserved, because high resolution dating is required to identify them, and the inference of almost simultaneous contraction and extension seems contradictory.},

  abstract = {The Cairngorm Mountain area of Scotland is a classic example of a landscape of selective linear glacial erosion, with sharp contrasts in the intensity of glacial erosion between the deeply incised troughs and valleys and the undulating high plateau. This article examines the Quaternary development of Glen Avon, a 200 m deep glacial trough set within the high plateau of the mountains. Evidence concerning the aggregate basal thermal regimes of the topographically controlled ice streams that formerly developed in this area is reconstructed from the geomorphological record, including bedforms indicative of wet-based, sliding ice and of dry-based ice frozen to its bed. This mapping indicates that basal sliding was not confined exclusively to the troughs but extended towards valley heads and on to parts of the plateau adjacent to troughs. The extent of basal sliding appears to have been greatest beneath pre-Late Devensian ice sheets. Basal ice temperatures are modelled under steady-state conditions for the last ice sheet at c. 18 ka BP. Basal thermal regimes are predicted using a reconstruction of the preglacial relief and for the current topography of the area. Convergent flow of ice through the preglacial valley system appears to have been sufficient to induce basal melting and therefore to initiate valley deepening. This effect is enhanced when the model is run across the present topography. Comparison of results of the geomorphological mapping and the modelling reveals significant differences between the actual and predicted extent of basal sliding outside the main ice stream. The overall conclusion is that many ice streams in mountainous terrain are inherited from the locations of preglacial valleys, which serve to accelerate ice flow and promote frictional heating beneath ice sheets.},

Analysis of Sr, Nd, Pb, Hf, and He isotope compositions of these new samples is shown together with published data from 66{$^\circ$}S to 53{$^\circ$}S and from the EPR. The recent advance in analytical mass spectrometry techniques generates a spectacular increase in the number of multidimensional isotopic data for oceanic basalts. Working with such multidimensional datasets generates a new approach for the data interpretation, preferably based on statistical analysis techniques. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a powerful mathematical tool to study this type of datasets. The purpose of PCA is to reduce the number of dimensions by keeping only those characteristics that contribute most to its variance. Using this technique, it becomes possible to have a statistical picture of the geochemical variations along the entire Pacific Ridge from 70{$^\circ$}S to 10{$^\circ$}S. The incomplete sampling of the ridge led previously to the identification of a large-scale division of the south Pacific mantle at the latitude of Easter Island. The PCA method applied here to the completed dataset reveals a different geochemical profile. Along the Pacific Ridge, a large-scale bell-shaped variation with an extremum at about 38{$^\circ$}S of latitude is interpreted as a progressive change in the geochemical characteristics of the depleted matrix of the mantle. This Pacific Isotopic Bump (PIB) is also noticeable in the He isotopic ratio along-axis variation. The linear correlation observed between He and heavy radiogenic isotopes, together with the result of the PCA calculation, suggests that the large-scale variation is unrelated to the plume--ridge interactions in the area and should rather be attributed to the partial melting of a marble-cake assemblage.}

  abstract = {Several defective assumptions have hindered understanding the evolution of Earth and its nearest neighbors. These include the claim that the Lu-Hf and Sm-Nd isotope systems can uniquely define oceanic rocks, acceptance of the ``CHondritic Uniform Reservoir'' (CHUR) model and a steadily depleting but fertile mantle, and belief that Proterozoic rocks exhibit features resembling those of Phanerozoic plate-tectonics. Earth's Archean was the era of internally mobile crust. In the period {\textasciitilde}4.0--2.5 b.y. tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite (TTG) crust formed by hydrous partial melting of a mafic protocrust leaving dense, depleted, garnet-rich residue. This delaminated and sank to at least 200\,km beginning top-down re-enrichment of the mantle. The remaining stabilized TTG crust directly underlay primordial low-density dunitic shallow mantle. Archean crust is granite and greenstone with no modern analogue. During the Proterozoic basins of volcanic and terrigenous sedimentary rocks formed on and between Archean shields. Where these basins thickened to {\textasciitilde}40\,km their deep regions partly melted by their own radioactivity and they were ``inverted'' by materials rich in highly evolved hydrous granites rising to mid-crustal level. This hydrous melting was enabled by a bombardment of icy bolides. Proterozoic dynamics were driven by vertical variations in density, reflect primarily the deposition and collapse of basins, and involved small horizontal motions only. Proterozoic paleomagnetic data cast doubt on the existence of a strong dipolar magnetic field at that time and there is no compelling evidence for Phanerozoic-like plate tectonics. Only near the end of the Proterozoic did downward recycling of fusible components enable a weak asthenosphere to develop over which lithospheric plates could slide. The Phanerozoic is the era of plate tectonics. Lithosphere motions are well documented by palaeomagnetism which suggests Earth's internal strong dipolar magnetic field may have developed at {\textasciitilde}600\,m.y. Organic evolution may have been enabled by these geodynamic changes. The Cambrian explosion of evolution produced all the phyla of modern animals within about 50\,m.y., possibly because the newly-formed strong dipolar magnetic field provided a shield against ionized radiation. Multidisciplinary evidence indicates that Earth, Mars, Venus and the Moon thoroughly fractionated early--by 4.5--4.4 b.y.---to form cores, refractory mantles and thick mafic crusts. All were bombarded by bolides that saturated their surfaces with impact craters and pools of impact-melted mafic protocrust that fractionated into layered igneous complexes. Venus, Mars and the Moon retain their heavily impacted surfaces. Their upper mantles have been solid and strong subsequently, they lack asthenospheres and liquid cores, and cannot sustain plate tectonics or mantle plumes. Variants of plume theory have been inappropriately exported to Venus and Mars to explain circular features and volcanism. Martian ``volcanoes'' and Venusian ``tessera plateaus'' are impact-melt products. A long-lasting global magma ocean on the Moon are falsified by petrology and the preservation of extremely ancient landscapes. Volatiles were delivered to Earth, The Moon, Mars, and Venus in a barrage of icy bolides starting at {\textasciitilde}4.0--3.9 b.y. which probably formed Earth's oceans and atmosphere. Oceans and their remnants survived for 2--3 b.y. on Venus and {\textasciitilde}1 b.y. on Mars. Melts on the Moon were water-enriched for perhaps 1 b.y. and there may have been ancient transient liquid water there also. Only Earth was internally hot and active enough to circulate the volatiles downward enabling hydrous melting, slow re-enrichment of the upper mantle and, at {\textasciitilde}600\,m.y., plate tectonics and rapid biological evolution.},

Investigations of qualitative sedimentologic and paleontologic redox proxies such as bioturbation and benthic assemblages from pelagic and hemipelagic sections suggest transient reductions in bottom water oxygen during this interval, possibly on a global scale. Here, we present bulk sediment manganese (Mn) and uranium (U) enrichment factors (EF) in Atlantic and Pacific deep-sea cores to constrain relative paleoredox changes across the PETM. Mn EF range from 1 to 9 in Atlantic sites, 1 to 35 in Southern Ocean sites, and are at crustal averages (EF51) in Pacific sites. U EF range from 1 to 5 in Atlantic sites, 1 to 90 in Southern Ocean sites, and are at crustal averages in Pacific sites. Our results indicate suboxic conditions prior to, during, and in the recovery from the PETM at intermediate depth sites in the Atlantic and Southern Ocean while the Pacific sites remained relatively oxygenated. The difference in oxygenation between the Atlantic and Pacific sites leads us to suggest the source for isotopically light carbon release during the PETM was in the Atlantic.},

The improvements in the database have allowed numerical representations of heat flow for southeastern and central segments of the Precambrian fold belts in Brazil, Central Andean cordilleras in Chile and Bolivia, Southern Volcanic arc in Peru, Neuquen Province in southwestern Argentina, Chaco basin in Paraguay, Oriente basin in Ecuador and the system of pericratonic basins in north central Colombia. The maps reveal considerable variability in heat flow, not only between the main tectonic units but also within them. The intra-regional variations seem to originate mainly from complexities in local geologic structures while the inter-regional ones seem to point to action of deep-seated tectonic processes. The cordilleran regions are, in general, characterized by relatively high heat flow ({\textbackslash}textgreater70 mW/m (super 2) ), compared with the coastal regions to the west and the Pre-cordilleran basins to the east. In the eastern part of the continent, heat flow is low to normal ({\textbackslash}textless60 mW/m (super 2) ), the exceptions being the Mesozoic rift basins, areas of Cenozoic alkaline intrusions and some isolated belts of overthrust tectonics in the central parts of Brazil. There are indications that heat flow is high in the Patagonian Platform relative to that found in the Brazilian Platform. In addition, polynomial methods were employed for examining large-scale variations of heat flow over the continent. Specifically, a general-purpose least square solution was used to determine the coefficients of up to fourth order in latitude and longitude. Some of the large-scale trends seen in low order polynomial representations seem to be indicative of the nature of deep-seated heat transfer processes. The systematic increase in regional heat flow in the north-south direction is an example. It is considered as the consequence of thermal blanketing effect of the continental segment of the South American lithosphere. Trends seen in higher order polynomials seem to be associated with regional tectonic patterns and subduction-related magmatism. Prominent among these are east-west trending belts of low heat flow in northern Peru and in central Chile, as well as the high heat flow belts in northern Chile, Altiplano of Bolivia and northwestern Argentina. Limitations arising from low data density and uneven geographic distribution warrant higher degree polynomial representations.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a preliminary analysis of the possibility of using post-glacial rebound observations to place constraints on the anisotropy of upper-mantle viscosity. We extend existing analyses by considering a visco-elastic, spherical, self-gravitating Earth. We show that three independent viscosity parameters are required to describe a Maxwell solid with transversely isotropic viscosity and isotropic elasticity. We develop a theoretical formalism for including the effects of transversely isotropic visco-elasticity in post-glacial rebound models. Using this formalism to describe anisotropy in the upper mantle, we model the free air gravity anomaly, relative sea-level changes, and present-day horizontal motion caused by the rebound, to assess their dependence on the upper-mantle viscosity parameters. We find that as long as those parameters are no larger than the lower-mantle (isotropic) viscosity, the results for the gravity and sea-level changes are notably sensitive to only one of the three viscosity parameters. This suggests, at least for the case where the lower-mantle viscosity is significantly larger than the upper-mantle viscosity, that post-glacial rebound studies of gravity and sea-level will be hard pressed to usefully constrain viscous anisotropy. We do find that the horizontal motion is relatively sensitive to transverse isotropy and so might be used, in principle, to constrain the anisotropy. In practice, though, it is likely that the strong dependence of horizontal motion on details of the ice model, coupled with the uncertainties in existing ice models, would make such attempts impractical. {\copyright} 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.},

The Pb isotopes show a non-Gaussian, ``fat tail'' distribution that is bimodal. The paired Hf and Pb isotope data, combined with previously published data, define two populations that reveal the presence of compositional streaks within the upper mantle. The number and density of the streaks follow a Poisson distribution where the characteristic streak thickness is {$\sim$}20km. The mantle `unit' giving rise to each MORB sample represents a `mixture of mixtures' with a multi-stage mixing history. There is no correlation of K/Ti or Na8 with Pb or Hf isotope ratios, and both domains encompass both N- and E-MORB sources, ruling out two different regimes of melting in a homogeneous source. Apparently, mantle convection has folded together distinct composite reservoirs of heterogeneous mantle, and stretched them into streaks that remain coherent and discernable units. The Hf and Pb isotope data reveal the presence of two distinct DUPAL mantle components in the upper mantle. The isotope signature of component 1 resembles a continental lithosphere source having Pb isotope composition similar to Karoo picrites (erupted at {$\sim$}180Ma). This component likely originated by mixing of Kaapvaal cratonic lithosphere and/or lower crust with the asthenosphere through mantle plume--lithosphere interaction during the early rifting stages of Gondwana. Component 2 likely originated from mixing of recycled oceanic lithosphere plus sediment with the asthenosphere (which had been previously contaminated by component 1) during the upwelling of Indian Ocean mantle plumes over the last 180Ma. The variation in Pb and Hf isotopes along the SEIR reveals that, while the two DUPAL components are spatially distributed in a Poisson fashion, and therefore well-mixed, their relative proportions are spatially variable in the Indian Ocean upper mantle.}

A two-dimensional (2D) orographic precipitation module is incorporated into the CHILD numerical landscape evolution model to provide a quantitative tool for exploring the co-evolution of rainfall patterns and fluvial topography. Our results suggest that network organization and planform morphology are strongly impacted by rainfall patterns. Rainfall gradients that are perpendicular to a mountain range front produce narrower watersheds because channels show a tendency to flow along the rainfall gradient, rather than across it. The change in watershed shape is evidenced by smaller values of the exponent on distance in Hack's law and a less peaked width function. Narrower watersheds also lead to an increase in the valley spacing ratio and constrain trunk channels to follow a more direct path to the mountain front. Rainfall gradients also influence the distribution of topography across a watershed. Channel profiles record rainfall patterns in both the channel concavity and the channel steepness index (ksn). Across short tributaries along which rainfall rate changes little, ksn decreases systematically with tributary-averaged rainfall rate. The hypsometric integral (HI), which increases with the amount of topography that is at relatively high elevations within a watershed, is negatively correlated with the profile concavity of the trunk channel. High rainfall rates at the ridge top lead to mainstem channels that have relatively low concavity, and watersheds with relatively higher HI in comparison with landscapes that have uniform rainfall. Finally, we contrast the impacts of rainfall patterns on landscape morphology with those resulting from a linear rock uplift gradient and uniform rainfall. Uplift patterns may have a similar impact on landscape morphology as rainfall gradients, making it challenging to decipher the relative roles of climate and tectonics on landscape evolution without a quantitative assessment of morphologic parameters.

Because the GISS analysis combines available sea surface temperature records with meteorological station measurements, we test alternative choices for the ocean data, showing that global temperature change is sensitive to estimated temperature change in polar regions where observations are limited. We suggest use of 12-month (and n{\texttimes}12) running mean temperature to fully remove the annual cycle and improve information content in temperature graphs. We conclude that global temperature continued to rise rapidly in the past decade, despite large year-to-year fluctuations associated with the El Ni{\~n}o-La Ni{\~n}a cycle of tropical ocean temperature.

The exposed eruption centres are small-volume scoria cones and lava shields, and both produced significant lava flows. Calculations of the emplacement times of the lava flows suggest the lava shields were active for about 6 months on average. Scoria cone eruptions probably lasted days to weeks. Despite relatively long repose periods between eruptions (about one eruption per 97000 years), few interflow sediments are preserved. Minimal physical erosion of the lavas probably reflects the shallow gradient of the Werribee Plains and the onset of arid climatic conditions in the late Cenozoic. Inflated pahoehoe lavas are the dominant volcanic facies in the Werribee Plains. Other lava facies identified include spongy (S-type) pahoehoe, ponded lavas, transitional lavas, and a thick, distal aa lava facies. The characteristics of the volcanic facies and their distribution in this volcanic province resemble those in the type example of basaltic plains provinces, the Snake River Plain, USA. Basaltic plains provinces are produced by a unique style of volcanism which has been largely unexplored compared with basaltic volcanism in other tectonic settings (such as flood basalt and ocean island volcanism). This study expands our understanding of the processes involved in the evolution of basaltic plains provinces. The volcanic facies association typical of basaltic plains provinces is better characterised here, thus aiding the future identification of these unique lava flow-fields elsewhere, in both modern and ancient sequences.},

Analogous to the Hawaiian swell, the low-density anomalies produce swells beneath the volcanoes on young seafloor. The associated gravity anomalies are part of a set of gravity lineaments that have been previously interpreted as being due to thermo-elastic cracking of the lithosphere or small-scale convection. The correlation between the surface volcanism and subsurface density and velocity anomalies and their extension to the spreading center suggest that pre-existing, buoyant or fertile asthenospheric mantle heterogeneities are stretched in the direction of plate motion by shear between the plate and the underlying mantle. These heterogeneities seed small-scale convection, producing upwelling and pressure release melting, forming volcanic chains that extend nearly to the ridge axis.},

Geochemical, geodetic, and tomographic studies reveal an along-strike transition from oceanic subduction to continental subduction and collision near central Flores that is due to a change of lithospheric composition in the subducting plate. To investigate the anisotropic fabric and dynamics of the upper mantle surrounding this young ({$\sim$}5~Ma) arc--continent collision, we perform shear wave splitting analysis on local and teleseismic S waves recorded by an array of broadband seismometers that crosses the subduction--collision boundary. Seismic anisotropy inferred from our local S dataset shows that anisotropic sources above the slab extend to depths exceeding 100~km. Analysis of teleseismic SKS and SKKS waves reveal a shift in subslab fast axes from trench-parallel to trench-perpendicular near the ocean--continent boundary in the lower plate, which we relate to regional subslab mantle flow being deflected around the subducted continental lithosphere. Along-strike variations in anisotropic fast axes from teleseismic phases overlap with distinct structural and tectonic boundaries that divide distinct regions of the collision, implying the effects of the collision transcend any one dataset and highlighting the complexity of collisional boundaries. These results shed light on the interaction between tectonic structure and mantle dynamics in an emergent collision, and help constrain the nature of upper mantle deformation in the early stages of collision.},

Because these boreholes penetrate layered sedimentary rocks with different thermal conductivities, Bullard plots (temperature versus integrated thermal resistance) are used to estimate background heat flow and surface temperature intercepts. Reduced temperatures, which represent departures from a constant heat flow condition, are inverted for a surface ground temperature history at each borehole site using a singular value decomposition algorithm. Singular value cutoffs are selected by analyzing the spectral energy and the standard deviation of the model fit to the data as a function of the number of eigenvalues; solutions are constructed from areas of large spectral energy and a cutoff where additional eigenvalues fail to improve the solution significantly. The solution is parameterized in terms of 13 time steps increasing in duration and going back 400 years. Eight of nine borehole sites indicate between 0.4 and 0.8{$^\circ$}C ({\textpm}0.2{$^\circ$} C) warming over the past 200 years with some evidence for accelerated warming in this century; one borehole indicates local cooling over the same time period.

  abstract = {In Northeast Japan, it remains a puzzle to reconcile the mismatch between long-term (geological) uplift and lateinterseismic and coseismic subsidence associated with the 2011 Tohoku earthquake. To explain this mismatch between different periods, we modeled the entire megathrust earthquake cycle in the Northeast Japan arc using a simple dislocation model with a two-layered lithosphere--asthenosphere structure in which we account for viscoelastic relaxation in the asthenosphere and tectonic erosion. The model behaves differently when the rupture stops within the lithosphere and when it cuts through the lithosphere to reach the asthenosphere. It is possible to explain the mismatch in the case where the rupture stops within the lithosphere. In the early interseismic stage, the viscoelastic response to the megathrust earthquake dominates and can compensate for late-interseismic and coseismic subsidence. In contrast, the late-interseismic stage is dominated by the locking effect with the steady slip below the rupture area. Tectonic erosion explains up to about half of the long-term uplift by landward movement of arc topography. The rest of the long-term uplift may be attributed to indirect effects of internal deformation in the arc.},

Several models involving one or more fixed plumes beneath the northeastward migrating African plate have been suggested to explain the space-time distribution of magmatism in east Africa. We devise paleogeographically constrained global models of mantle convection and, based on the evolution of flow in the deepest lower mantle, show that the Afar plume migrated southward throughout its lifetime. The models suggest that the mobile Afar plume provides a dynamically consistent explanation for the spatial extent of the southward propagation of the east African rift system (EARS), which is difficult to explain by the northeastward migration of Africa over one or more fixed plumes alone, over the last \%45 Myr. We further show that the age-progression of volcanism associated with the southward propagation of EARS is consistent with the apparent surface hotspot motion that results from southward motion of the modelled Afar plume beneath the northeastward migrating African plate. The models suggest that the Afar plume became weaker as it migrated southwards, consistent with trends observed in the geochemical record.},

Both models fit to reasonable values of misfit, but only the plate cooling model is acceptable after considering additional statistical constraints. The best-fitting plate model results in a thinner lithospheric thickness (90km) than previous estimates. These results improve estimates of global heat loss rate through oceanic crust (29.4TW, {$\sim$}44TW globally) and improves the estimated temporal evolution of the thermal structure of oceanic lithosphere suggesting a shallower lithosphere--asthenosphere boundary.

The best-fitting partition model using elevation data from 33 North American tectonic provinces suggests upper crustal heat production on average accounts for {$\sim$}6\% of observed surface heat flow. An average heat production for the lower crust of 0.4{$\mu$}W/m3 is based on measurements from exposed granulite terranes while a lithospheric mantle heat production of 0.02{$\mu$}W/m3 is based on chemical analyses of mantle xenoliths. Results are relatively insensitive to mantle composition and thickness of the upper crustal heat producing layer. Continental geotherms are computed using the generalized heat production model and incorporating thermal conductivity results from a number of recent laboratory studies. P-T conditions of xenoliths provide further constraints to ensure that our geotherms and hence the heat production model are reasonable. P-T conditions of 10 Precambrian regions are consistent with surface heat flow of 40mW/m2 and a lithospheric thickness of 200km. Our generalized model for heat production can serve as a reference model from which anomalies are identified. {\copyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

We present a global compilation of active plate boundaries and geological provinces in a shapefile format with interpretive attributes (e.g., crust type, plate type, province type, last orogeny).  The initial plate and province boundaries are constructed from a combination of published global and regional models that we refine using a variety of geoscientific constraints including, but not limited to, relative GPS motions, earthquakes, mapped faults, potential field characteristics, and geochronology.  These new plate model show improved correlation to observed earthquake and volcano occurrences within deformation zones and microplates, compared to existing models, capturing 73 and 80\% of these criteria, respectively.  We estimate 57.7\% of the Earth's surface is covered by oceanic crust, which is a slight increase relative to the most recent seafloor age model. The model of last orogenies agrees well with peaks in the globally summed geochronology data. There is room for improvement in future editions of our global plate and geologic provinces model where basins, ice, or lack of geological data fidelity obscure bedrock geology, particularly in the eastern Central Asian Orogenic Belt, much of Africa, East Antarctica, and eastern Australia.  Additionally, some province types---orogens, shields, and cratons that are homogenized within our global scheme---can likely be partitioned into smaller terranes with more precise geodynamic attributes.  Despite some of these shortcomings, the digital maps presented here form a self-consistent data standard for adding spatial metadata to geoscientific databases. The database is available on GitHub where the geoscience community can provide updates to improve the models and their contemporaneity as new knowledge is acquired.

Many heat flow values in seafloor younger than 60Ma are lower than predicted by models of conductively cooled lithosphere. This heat flow deficit is caused by ventilated hydrothermal circulation recharge and discharge at crustal outcrops or areas of thin sedimentary cover. Filtering heat flow data, retaining only sites with {\textbackslash}textgreater400m of sediment cover and located {\textbackslash}textgreater60km from the nearest seamount, minimizes the effect of hydrothermal ventilation. Filtered heat flow exhibits a much higher correlation coefficient with seafloor age (up to 0.95 for filtered data in contrast to 0.5 for unfiltered data) and lower variability (reduction by 30\%) within an age bin. A small heat flow deficit still persists at ages {\textbackslash}textless25Ma, possibly as a result of global filtering limitations and incomplete thermal rebound following sediment burial. Detailed heat flow surveys co-located with seismic data can identify environments favoring conductive heat flow; heat flow collected in these environments is higher than that determined by the filtered global dataset, and is more consistent with conductive cooling of the lithosphere. The new filtered data analysis and the growing number of site specific surveys both support estimates of global heat loss in the range 40--47 TW.},

Understanding the average behavior and variability of heat production for these rock types are vitally important for developing accurate models of lithospheric temperature. We analyze the heat production of {$\sim$}204,000 whole rock geochemical data to quantify how heat production of these rocks varies with respect to chemistry and their evolution during metamorphism. The heat production of metaigneous and metasedimentary rocks are similar to their respective protoliths. Igneous and metaigneous samples increase in heat production with increasing SiO2and K2O, but decrease with increasing FeO, MgO and CaO. Sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks increase in heat production with increasing Al2O3, FeO, TiO2, and K2O but decrease with increasing CaO. For both igneous and sedimentary rocks, the heat production variations are largely correlated with processes that affect K2O concentration and covary with other major oxides as a consequence. Among sedimentary rocks, aluminous shales are the highest heat producing (2.9 {$\mu$}W m-3) whereas more common iron shales are lower heat producing (1.7 {$\mu$}W m-3). Pure quartzites and carbonates are the lowest heat producing sedimentary rocks. Globally, there is little definitive evidence for a decrease in heat production with increasing metamorphic grade. However, there remains the need for high resolution studies of heat production variations within individual protoliths that vary in metamorphic grade. These results improve estimates of heat production and natural variability of rocks that will allow for more accurate temperature models of the lithosphere.},

We estimate an anomalous radiogenic heat production across much of eastern Australia generally accounting for {\textbackslash}textgreater50 mW m-2, while western Australia appears to have high crustal compositionally corrected elevation, possibly related to chemical buoyancy of the mantle lithosphere. A moderately high sub-lithospheric heat flow ({$\sim$}40 mW m-2) along the eastern and southeastern coast, including Tasmania, is coincident with locations of Cenozoic volcanism and supports an edge-driven convection hypothesis. However, the pattern of sub-lithospheric heat flow along the margin does not support the existence of hotspot tracks. Thermo-isostatic models such as these improve our ability to identify and quantify crustal from mantle sources of heat loss and add valuable constraints on tectonic and geodynamic models of the continental lithosphere's physical state and evolution.},

These models are based on traveltime interpretations of primary and reflected P- and S-wave seismic phases generated by explosive underwater sources. The quality of the shear wave data is exceptional when compared to similar data sets recorded elsewhere and allows the distribution of Poisson's ratio (\&sigma;) within the entire crust to be accurately determined. Models of Poisson's ratio, V{\textbackslash}textlessinf{\textbackslash}textgreaterp{\textbackslash}textless/inf{\textbackslash}textgreater and V{\textbackslash}textlessinf{\textbackslash}textgreaters{\textbackslash}textless/inf{\textbackslash}textgreater are then used to constrain crustal composition at various depths down to the Moho (ca. 32 km depth) using published laboratory velocity measurements from rocks of different metamorphic grades and chemistry. The results indicate that the Irish crust in this region of the Caledonian orogenic belt is unusually felsic in bulk composition with a \&sigma; value of 0.247, which is below the global average value of 0.265. Variations in \&sigma; within the upper ca. 5 km of crust are greatest (0.20-0.28) and can be correlated with siliciclastic and carbonate sediments in Devonian and Carboniferous extensional sedimentary basins that were formed during the early part of the Variscan orogenic cycle. The typically more uniform variation in the mid crust down to 15 km depth is consistent with a granite/granodiorite or metagreywacke composition of greenschist to amphibolite facies mineralogy. Within the lower crust the value of \&sigma; (0.257-0.265) is significantly less than the global mean value of 0.281 predicted from an average crustal petrology model. This suggests a bulk silica content (\%SiO{\textbackslash}textlessinf{\textbackslash}textgreater2{\textbackslash}textless/inf{\textbackslash}textgreater) of \&sim;64 per cent for the lower crust, based on an empirical relationship between \&sigma; and \%SiO{\textbackslash}textlessinf{\textbackslash}textgreater2{\textbackslash}textless/inf{\textbackslash}textgreater, determined from compilations of laboratory data. These results are consistent with petrophysical, geochemical and petrological data from an unusually well-preserved lower crustal xenolith suite from the Irish Midlands, hosted in early Carboniferous volcanic rocks.

  abstract = {Summary In geophysical inversion, inferences of Earth's properties from sparse data involve a trade-off between model complexity and the spatial resolving power. A recent Markov chain Monte Carlo (McMC) technique formalized by Green, the so-called trans-dimensional samplers, allows us to sample between these trade-offs and to parsimoniously arbitrate between the varying complexity of candidate models. Here we present a novel framework using trans-dimensional sampling over tree structures. This new class of McMC sampler can be applied to 1-D, 2-D and 3-D Cartesian and spherical geometries. In addition, the basis functions used by the algorithm are flexible and can include more advanced parametrizations such as wavelets, both in Cartesian and Spherical geometries, to permit Bayesian multiscale analysis. This new framework offers greater flexibility, performance and efficiency for geophysical imaging problems than previous sampling algorithms. Thereby increasing the range of applications and in particular allowing extension to trans-dimensional imaging in 3-D. Examples are presented of its application to 2-D seismic and 3-D teleseismic tomography including estimation of uncertainty.}

This process allows the planet to respond to external forcings (i.e., changes in insolation, changes in volcanic outgassing rates, etc.) and regulate its surface temperature through negative feedbacks on atmospheric CO2 involved in silicate weathering. Continental weathering and seafloor weathering rates have different, non-linear dependencies on pCO2 and will respond differently to changes in external forcings. Because waterworlds (planets with only seafloor weathering) have a weaker pCO2 dependence than continental worlds (such as modern Earth), we find that waterworlds are better at resisting changes in surface temperature resulting from perturbations in insolation than their continental counterparts, and may be more habitable in this respect.},

  abstract = {It is well documented that the Cenozoic progressive flooding of Australia, contemporaneous with a eustatic sea level fall, requires a downward tilting of the Australian Plate towards the SE Asian subduction system. Previously, this large-scale, mantle-convection driven dynamic topography effect has been approximated by computing the time-dependent vertical shifts and tilts of a plane, but the observed subsidence and uplift anomalies indicate a more complex interplay between time-dependent mantle convection and plate motion. We combine plate kinematics with a global mantle backward-advection model based on shear-wave mantle tomography, paleogeographic data, eustatic sea level estimates and basin stratigraphy to reconstruct the Australian flooding history for the last 70 Myrs on a continental scale. We compute time-dependent dynamic surface topography and continental inundation of a digital elevation model adjusted for sediment accumulation. Our model reveals two evolving dynamic topography lows, over which the Australian plate has progressively moved. We interpret the southern low to be caused by sinking slab material with an origin along the eastern Gondwana subduction zone in the Cretaceous, whereas the northern low, which first straddles northern Australia in the Oligocene, is mainly attributable to material subducted north and northeast of Australia. Our model accounts for the Paleogene exposure of the Gulf of Carpentaria region at a time when sea level was much higher than today, and explains anomalous Late Tertiary subsidence on Australia's northern, western and southern margins. The resolution of our model, which excludes short-wavelength mantle density anomalies and is restricted to depths larger than 220 km, is not sufficient to model the two well recorded episodes of major transgressions in South Australia in the Eocene and Miocene. However, the overall, long-wavelength spatio-temporal pattern of Australia's inundation record is well captured by combining our modelled dynamic topography with a recent eustatic sea level curve. We suggest that the apparent Late Cenozoic northward tilting of Australia was a stepwise function of South Australia first moving away northwards from the Gondwana subduction-related dynamic topography low in the Oligocene, now found under the Australian--Antarctic Discordance, followed by a drawingdownof northern Australia as it overrode a slab burial ground now underlying much of the northern half of Australia, starting in the Miocene. Our model suggests that today's geography of Australia is strongly dependent on mantle forces. Without mantle convection, which draws Australia down by up to 300 m, nearly all of Australia's continental shelves would be exposed. We conclude that dissecting the interplay between eustasy and mantle-driven dynamic topography is critical for understanding hinterland uplift, basin subsidence, the formation and destruction of shallow epeiric seas and their facies distribution, but also for the evolution of petroleum systems.},

We have developed a GIS based forward modeling technique to model these anomaly maps. On the basis of the geologic and tectonic maps of the world, laboratory susceptibility values of the occurring rock types, and the seismic thickness of the crust, a vertically integrated susceptibility grid is generated in the GIS system. In addition, a remanent magnetization grid is computed for the oceanic crust using a digital isochron map of the ocean floor and rotation models of the paleoplates. Combining the global VIS and remanent magnetization grids, the vertical magnetic field anomaly is computed at satellite altitude and compared with the corresponding CHAMP magnetic anomaly map. Over the oceans, induced and remanent magnetization explains well the prominent observed anomalies over the Cretaceous quiet zones. We also find a good agreement between predicted and observed anomalies over the continents. Remaining discrepancies between the predicted and observed anomalies can be used to adjust poorly known boundaries and the composition of the buried Precambrian provinces, until the recomputed anomalies fit the observed anomalies. The feasibility of this approach is demonstrated on Greenland, the West African Craton, Bangui in central Africa, and the Kolyma-Omolon Block in Siberia. We conclude that quantitative information on the lateral extent, the composition and the thickness of the lower crust within a Precambrian province can thus be inferred from the new satellite magnetic anomaly maps.},

It abuts a basement of mafic-ultramafic rocks (Gray Creek Complex) and overlying Early Ordovician deep marine sedimentary and volcanic strata (Judea Formation) which host tonalitic plutons. The terrane lies at the western, inboard-margin of the Camel Creek Subprovince, a broad tract of multiply deformed mid-Paleozoic turbidites with minor basalt and chert variously interpreted as the infill of a backarc basin or an accretionary wedge. U-Pb dates from detrital zircon indicate a maximum Late Silurian age for siliciclastic rocks from the previously undated Wairuna Formation. Geochemistry of volcanic rocks from the volcano-sedimentary terrane show them to be largely of mafic to intermediate compositions of calc-alkaline affinity, comparable with broadly coeval Macquarie Arc volcanic suites of the southern Tasmanides. Trace-element systematics identify a subduction relationship for the volcanic suite and V/Ti employed as a discrimination tool identifies the terrane as representing an oceanic island arc, consistent with its sedimentary facies which include volcaniclastic mass flow deposits, limestone, and radiolarian chert. Continent-derived sandstone in the sedimentary assemblage, confirmed by the ages of detrital zircon from a sandstone sample from the Carriers Well Formation, indicates that the oceanic island arc developed proximal to the Late Ordovician continental margin of East Gondwana. Its nature and location bear on the tectonic setting of the entire Camel Creek Subprovince, for which interpretation as an Early Silurian-Early Devonian accretionary wedge is favoured. Collision of the island arc with the continental margin, and associated deformation of part the intervening oceanic crustal tract, now represented by the Gray Creek Complex and its sedimentary cover (Judea Formation) registers the initiation of subduction accretion in late Early Silurian (Llandoverian) time. It marks earlystage orogenesis in the Broken River Province, accurately timed by stratigraphic relationships in the basinal succession developed in the Graveyard Creek Subprovince immediately to the west of the arc assemblage. Tectonism was regionally developed in north Queensland at this time, coeval with the Benambran Orogeny of the Lachlan Orogen in which the Macquarie Arc was likewise accreted to the East Gondwana margin. Benambran orogenesis marks a general phase of shortening, and removal by subduction, of oceanic crust and inversion of continent-derived overlying sedimentary cover along the East Gondwana margin. \&copy; 2011 Geological Society of Australia.},

  abstract = {We test the sensitivity of combined U-Pb-Hf isotopic analyses of detrital and magmatic zircon to document complex processes in accretionary orogens, using Ganderia from the Canadian Appalachian orogen as an example. Ganderia hosted a long-lived magmatic arc that began at least by 650 Ma and continued until 450 Ma, during which time it drifted northward from the Amazonian margin. Its isotopic record suggests arc activity began earlier, possibly at {$\sim$}750 Ma (proto-Ganderia) within an oceanic domain. The U-Pb-Hf zircon isotopic array suggests that Ganderia formed on a sliver of Paleoproterozoic-Mesoproterozoic basement (TDMc = 2.2--1.1 Ga). A transition towards more evolved Hf isotopic compositions between 650 and 600 Ma is interpreted to coincide with its accretion to the Amazonian margin of Gondwana, consistent with other geological evidence. Accretion was followed by increasing amounts of juvenile crustal inputs between {$\sim$}550 and 500 Ma, which is interpreted to reflect subduction roll-back and the onset of drift from the Gondwanan margin. Trench retreat culminated in the separation of the Ganderia arc and formation of the exclusively oceanic {$\sim$}510--450 Ma Penobscot-Popelogan-Victoria arcs on Ganderia. Accretion of Ganderia to the active Notre Dame Subzone along the Laurentian margin occurred in the late Ordovician and is marked by the abrupt termination of Ganderian arc magmatism. The Notre Dame arc evolved along the Laurentian margin between {$\sim$}515 and 425 Ma and was built on Paleoproterozoic-Archean (T(DM)c = 2.9--2.5 Ga) crust. Supra-subduction zone magmatism occurred at {$\sim$}490--460 Ma during the closure of the Taconic Seaway and was dominated by the recycling of Laurentian crust, with progressive mixing of evolved and juvenile arc magmas over time. The preservation of very evolved Notre Dame arc zircon in Ganderian overstep sequences confirms the arrival of the leading edge of Ganderia to Laurentia by {$\sim$}450 Ma. The hafnium isotopic method is proven here to be a powerful tool when used in conjunction with geological constraints, and is able to identify the changing nature of magmatism during the evolution of complex accretionary systems.},

The models span the lower 500 km of Earth's mantle, employ both temperature and melting-related contributions to buoyancy, and include a cold randomly moving downwelling introduced from above to maintain a thermal boundary layer. Partial melting of ordinary mantle introduces a ubiquitous partially molten layer above an isothermal core-mantle boundary as a consequence of its isothermal and isobaric conditions, although it naturally develops variations in thickness greater than two orders of magnitude, with the thickest portions occurring at the base of upwelling plumes and a thin layer elsewhere. We find that only a dense partially molten mixture produces partial melt distributions that are compatible with seismic observations of ULVZ; however, if such a melt percolates downward a dense basal liquid layer accumulates above the core-mantle boundary. The apparent requirement of a volumetrically dense and non-percolating melt phase in the lowermost mantle presents serious problems for the hypothesis that ULVZ arise from melting of ordinary mantle, and suggests that such features likely form as a consequence of more complex processes. Furthermore, these considerations suggest that the solidus of ordinary mantle is a reasonable upper bound on the present day temperature of the CMB. ?? 2007.},

However, the influence of its thickness and/or strength on orogenic systems evolution remains largely unknown. Here we present results from 3D thermo-mechanical numerical simulations of convergence zones (including oceanic subduction followed by continental subduction/collision), in which we vary the rheological profile of the overriding plate (OP). For this, we systematically modify the crustal thickness of the overriding lithosphere and the temperature at the Moho to obtain a thermal thickness of the overriding lithosphere ranging from 80 to 180 km. While all models share a common global evolution (i.e., slab sinking, interaction between slab and the 660 km discontinuity, continental subduction/collision, and slab breakoff), they also highlight first-order differences arising from the variations in the OP strength (thermal thickness). With a thin/weak OP, slab rollback is favored, the slab dip is low, the mantle flow above the slab is vigorous, and the trench migrates at a high rate compared to a thick/strong OP. In addition, slab breakoff and back-arc basin formation events occur significantly earlier than in models involving a thick OP. Our models therefore highlight the major role played by the thickness/strength of the OP on convergence zone dynamics and illustrate its influence in a quantitative way.}

  abstract = {In this paper we present a stochastic dimension reduction multiscale finite element method for solving groundwater flow problems in heterogeneous random porous media. The stochastic conductivity is parameterized in a stochastic space using a truncated Karhunen--Lo{\`e}ve expansion with finite random variables. This often results in high stochastic dimensionality due to small correlation length and large variance of the inherent covariance function. In order to treat the high-dimensional stochastic problems efficiently, a truncated high-dimensional model representation (HDMR) technique is proposed that decomposes the high-dimensional stochastic problem into a moderate-dimensional stochastic problem and a few one-dimensional stochastic problems. The derived low-dimensional stochastic problems are solved by incorporating a sparse grid stochastic collocation method (SGSCM) with the proposed HDMR. This leads to a set of uncoupled deterministic problems at the sparse grid collocation points. To capture the small-scale heterogeneities in physical space, a multiscale finite element method (MsFEM) is utilized to solve these deterministic problems. Since the SGSCM and MsFEM are implemented in the different spaces, the integrated approach inherits the advantages from both of the SGSCM and the MsFEM, in which each low-dimensional stochastic problem is decoupled each other at small number of stochastic collocation points and is solved on a coarse spatial mesh. To demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed stochastic MsFEM with the HDMR technique, a few numerical experiments are carried out for the transient water flow problems in heterogeneous random media with different correlation lengths and various degrees of spatial variabilities.},

Samples were investigated by mercury- and Wood's metal injection, SEM, XRD, and grain size analysis. Wood's metal injection has the advantage of visualising the 'frozen' injection process. The smallest pore casts observed were down to 40 nm in diameter, while the largest, bottle-shaped pores were up to 5 ??m in diameter. Bottle-shaped pores occurred in all the samples, usually around silt or sand grains. One sample, which had a porosity of 28.5\% according to mercury injection data, had not been impregnated by the molten alloy. We suggest this to reflect a strong deformation of the clay fabric by the high pressure without intrusion into the matrix. This raises questions about the reliability of mercury injection data for very fine-grained, highly porous sediments. After excluding these very fine-grained samples and one very calcareous sample regressions were found which relate porosity (??), clay content (C), and sand content (S) to capillary displacement pressure (P d(Hg)): P d(Hg)=-25.05+0.63 C+0.29S (R 2=0.92), and P d(Hg)=-10.24+0.47 C-0.15??

  abstract = {The passive margin of the South Atlantic shows typical features of a rifted volcanic continental margin, encompassing seaward dipping reflectors, continental flood basalts and high-velocity/density lower crust at the continent--ocean transition, probably emplaced during initial seafloor spreading in the Early Cretaceous. The Springbok profile offshore western South Africa is a combined transect of reflection and refraction seismic data. This paper addresses the analysis of the seismic velocity structure in combination with gravity modelling and isostatic modelling to unravel the crustal structure of the passive continental margin from different perspectives. The velocity modelling revealed a segmentation of the margin into three distinct parts of continental, transitional and oceanic crust. As observed at many volcanic margins, the lower crust is characterised by a zone of high velocities with up to 7.4 km/s. The conjunction with gravity modelling affirms the existence of this body and at the same time substantiated its high densities, found to be 3100 kg/m3. Both approaches identified the body to have a thickness of about 10 km. Yet, the gravity modelling predicted the transition between the high-density body towards less dense material farther west than initially anticipated from velocity modelling and confirmed this density gradient to be a prerequisite to reproduce the observed gravity signal. Finally, isostatic modelling was applied to predict average crustal densities if the margin was isostatically balanced. The results imply isostatic equilibrium over large parts of the profile, smaller deviations are supposed to be compensated regionally. The calculated load distribution along the profile implies that all pressures are hydrostatic beneath a depth of 45 km.},

  abstract = {Parameterizations of experimental data constraining the influence of CO2 and H2O on silicate melting, combined with experimental data on the stability of carbonatite in the upper mantle, allow calculation of the stability of partial melts in the seismic low velocity zone (LVZ) beneath oceanic lithosphere. For mantle with volatile contents similar to the sources of mid-ocean ridge basalt (100ppm H2O, 60ppm CO2), small amounts of melt are thermodynamically stable throughout the LVZ. On a weight basis, CO2 has less influence than H2O in stabilizing near-solidus partial melts of peridotite, but stability of volatile-rich near-solidus melts is dominated by CO2 rather than H2O because CO2 is less compatible than H2O in peridotite. For mantle potential temperatures (MPT) ranging from 1300 to 1400{$^\circ$}C, CO2-rich silicate melts are stable to depths of 130--180km and carbonatite stable at greater depths and also in the shallow regions (70--100km) beneath older lithosphere. Calculated melt fractions of carbonatite do not exceed 0.024\% and silicate melt fractions are {\textbackslash}textless0.1\% beneath older ({\textbackslash}textgreater40Ma) lithosphere, except for a thin region at {$\sim$}120km when the MPT approaches 1400{$^\circ$}C. These melt fractions are maxima if compaction is effective over the {$\sim$}100Ma life of oceanic lithosphere. The regions of high melt fraction correspond broadly with the locus of low shear wave velocity imaged tomographically, though the melt fractions present may be too small to account for the seismic characteristics of the LVZ. Carbonatite cannot be present in large regions of the LVZ, particularly at intermediate depths (60--145km) beneath young lithosphere ({\textbackslash}textless40Ma), and therefore cannot be responsible for the high electrical conductivity of this part of the LVZ, as has recently been proposed (Gaillard et al., 2008). Horizontal lenses of melt beneath the lithosphere/asthenosphere boundary may be responsible for the sharp seismic G discontinuity that marks the lithosphere/asthenosphere boundary in oceanic domains, but if so they must consist of melt collected at that horizon by percolation of deeper magmas or melt concentrated in high aspect ratio enriched heterogeneities.}

  abstract = {Diffuse intraplate volcanism spanning the Cenozoic on the North, South, Chatham, Auckland, Campbell and Antipodes Islands of New Zealand has produced quartz tholeiitic to basanitic/nephelinitic (including their differentiates) monogenetic volcanic fields and large shield volcanoes. New 40Ar/39Ar ages, combined with published age data, show no correlations among age, location or composition of the volcanoes. Continuous volcanism in restricted areas over long time periods, and a lack of volcanic age progressions in the direction and at the rate of plate motion, are inconsistent with a plume origin for the intraplate volcanism. Although localized extension took place during some episodes of volcanic activity, the degree of extension does not correlate with erupted volumes or compositions. Major and trace element data suggest that the silica-poor volcanic rocks (primarily basanites) were derived through low degrees of partial melting at deeper depths than the more silica-rich volcanic rocks (alkali basalts and tholeiites) and that all melts were produced from ocean island basalt (OIB)-type sources, containing garnet pyroxenite or eclogite. The Sr--Nd--Pb isotope data indicate that the silica-poor rocks were derived from high time-integrated U/Pb (HIMU)-type sources and the silica-rich rocks from more enriched mantle (EM)-type sources, reflecting greater interaction with lithosphere modified by subduction beneath Gondwana. The first-order cause of melting is inferred to be decompression melting in the garnet stability field of upwelling asthenosphere, triggered by removal (detachment) of different parts of the subcontinental lithospheric keel throughout the Cenozoic. In some cases, large thicknesses of keel were removed and magmatism extended over many millions of years. Decompression melting beneath a thick craton generates melts that are likely to be similar to those from the base of the mid-ocean-ridge melting column. At mid-ocean ridges, however, these melts never reach the surface in their pure form due to the swamping effect of larger-degree melts formed at shallower depths. Different volcanic styles in part reflect the mode of removal, and size and shape of detached parts of the lithospheric keel. Removal of continental lithospheric mantle could be an important process for explaining the origin of diffuse igneous provinces on continental lithosphere.}

  abstract = {This paper presents a method for the systematic trace element modelling of a cogenetic suite of lavas. It is based on the geochemical inversion technique of All{\`e}gre and coworkers and utilizes the variations in the trace element concentrations of the lavas to calculate initial concentrations and source mineralogy. We reduce this inversion to a simple, step-by-step procedure: (1) correcting for fractional crystallization; (2) testing the inferred primary melt compositions for consistency with a model of equilibrium partial melts (with constant partition coefficients) formed from identical sources; (3) estimating the proportions of mineral phases entering the melt; (4) computing concentrations and bulk partition coefficients in the initial source relative to the concentration of a common reference element; (5) estimating relative mineral abundances in the source. Except for the fractionation correction, the calculations are done element by element using a direct analytic solution. For the purpose of comparison we apply this method to the same set of data used by Minster and All{\`e}gre (1978), a suite of lavas from Grenada (lesser Antilles) originally analyzed by Shimizu and Arculus (1975). The results of both methods agree well for the source abundances of the light REE, whereas the heavy REE abundances are shown to be poorly constrained by the data. Both methods require residual clinopyroxene and garnet in the source, but the ratio of these minerals is not well constrained. We are unable to reproduce the shape of D0 pattern (=bulk partition coefficients of the initial source) given by Minster and All{\`e}gre. The reason for this cannot be evaluated without repeating their calculations in detail. The set of data from Grenada is useful for comparison of the methods only, because it is now known from isotopic data that the samples are not truly cogenetic. Possibly better suited sets of samples for petrogenetic modelling are presented in parts II and III of this series. {\copyright} 1983 Springer-Verlag.}

  abstract = {The average chemical compositions of the continental crust and the oceanic crust (represented by MORB), normalized to primitive mantle values and plotted as functions of the apparent bulk partition coefficient of each element, form surprisingly simple, complementary concentration patterns. In the continental crust, the maximum concentrations are on the order of 50 to 100 times the primitive-mantle values, and these are attained by the most highly incompatible elements Cs, Rb, Ba, and Th. In the average oceanic crust, the maximum concentrations are only about 10 times the primitive mantle values, and they are attained by the moderately incompatible elements Na, Ti, Zr, Hf, Y and the intermediate to heavy REE. This relationship is explained by a simple, two-stage model of extracting first continental and then oceanic crust from the initially primitive mantle. This model reproduces the characteristic concentration maximum in MORB. It yields quantitative constraints about the effective aggregate melt fractions extracted during both stages. These amount to about 1.5\% for the continental crust and about 8-10\% for the oceanic crust. The comparatively low degrees of melting inferred for average MORB are consistent with the correlation of Na2O concentration with depth of extrusion [1], and with the normalized concentrations of Ca, Sc, and Al (\{reversed tilde equals\} 3) in MORB, which are much lower than those of Zr, Hf, and the HREE (\{reversed tilde equals\} 10). Ca, Al and Sc are compatible with clinopyroxene and are preferentially retained in the residual mantle by this mineral. This is possible only if the aggregate melt fraction is low enough for the clinopyroxene not to be consumed. A sequence of increasing compatibility of lithophile elements may be defined in two independent ways: (1) the order of decreasing normalized concentrations in the continental crust; or (2) by concentration correlations in oceanic basalts. The results are surprisingly similar except for Nb, Ta, and Pb, which yield inconsistent bulk partition coefficients as well as anomalous concentrations and standard deviations. The anomalies can be explained if Nb and Ta have relatively large partition coefficients during continental crust production and smaller coefficients during oceanic crust production. In contrast, Pb has a very small coefficient during continental crust production and a larger coefficient during oceanic crust production. This is the reason why these elements are useful in geochemical discrimination diagrams for distinguishing MORB and OIB on the one hand from island arc and most intracontinental volcanics on the other. The results are consistent with the crust-mantle differentiation model proposed previously [2]. Nb and Ta are preferentially retained and enriched in the residual mantle during formation of continental crust. After separation of the bulk of the continental crust, the residual portion of the mantle was rehomogenized, and the present-day internal heterogeneities between MORB and OIB sources were generated subsequently by processes involving only oceanic crust and mantle. During this second stage, Nb and Ta are highly incompatible, and their abundances are anomalously high in both OIB and MORB. The anomalous behavior of Pb causes the so-called "lead paradox", namely the elevated U/Pb and Th/Pb ratios (inferred from Pb isotopes) in the present-day, depleted mantle, even though U and Th are more incompatible than Pb in oceanic basalts. This is explained if Pb is in fact more incompatible than U and Th during formation of the continental crust, and less incompatible than U and Th during formation of oceanic crust. {\copyright} 1988.}

For all minerals examined so-far using laser-flash analysis, the lattice component of the thermal conductivity of the mantle asymptotes to a constant above a critical temperature of {$\sim$}1500K. Radiative transfer calculated from absorption spectra has thresholds in both grain-size and Fe content, and a rather complex dependence on temperature. These critical phenomena impact convection of the lower mantle, because the lattice contribution tends to destabilize the cold boundary layers, whereas radiative transfer mostly promotes stability in the lower mantle, unless the grains are large and Fe-rich, which makes convection chaotic and time-dependent. The specific behavior suggests that flow in the lower mantle is sluggish, whereas flow in the upper mantle-transition zone is time-dependent. The decrease in krad as Fe/(Fe+Mg) increases beyond {$\sim$}0.1 may be connected with formation of lower mantle, thermo-chemical plumes through positive feedback.}

  abstract = {Locally diffusive, radiative heat transport inside the earth is represented by an effective thermal conductivity (krad,dif), calculated from spectra. Previous geophysical models assumed that emissivity ({$\xi$}) equals unity, which violates local radiative equilibrium in an internally heated, grainy medium. Our new formulation accounts for {$\xi$} depending on frequency, physical scattering depending on grain-size (d), and for light lost through back-reflections at interfaces. Mantle values of krad,dif are estimated from recent visible spectra of olivine combined with new IR data. The following trends hold for krad,dif calculated from olivine spectra, and should be equally valid for pyroxene and spinel: (1) pressure is unimportant, (2) radiative thermal conductivity depends non-linearly on d, temperature (T), and Fe2+ content (X), (3) maxima occur in krad,dif(d) when the grains are large enough to emit substantially, but not so large that light is strongly attenuated within a single-grain, (4) the dependence of krad,dif on Fe2+ content parallels that with d because absorption is controlled by the product dX (Beer's law), and (5) a local minimum occurs in krad,dif near 2000K for d{\textbackslash}textgreater2mm because at that temperature the peak position of the blackbody curve coincides with that of the strongly absorbing Fe2+ peak in the visible. Larger krad,dif exists at lower and higher temperatures because mean free paths are long in the transmitting near-IR and UV spectral regions. As integration smooths over spectral details, the above representation based on olivine becomes increasingly accurate for other phases as grain-size decreases. For conditions expected in the transition zone, {$\partial$}krad,dif/{$\partial$}T is negative, which is destabilizing [Dubuffet, F., Yuen, D.A., Rainey, E.S.G., 2002. Controlling thermal chaos in the mantle by positive feedback from radiative thermal conductivity. Nonlinear Proc. Geophys. 9, 1--13]. In the lower mantle, photon transport dominates phonon, promoting stable, weak convection. That radiative transfer is linked to chemical composition and grain-size suggests that this process impacts planetary evolution through the non-linear feedback with rheology.}

To evaluate accuracy, repeat experiments for olivine [(Mg(0.9)Fe(0.1))(2)SiO4], quartz (SiO2), and NaCl are examined in detail: these and other data on electrical insulators are compared with theory. At ambient conditions, D is underestimated in proportion to the number of contacts. As temperature (T) increases, spurious radiative transfer more than offsets contact loss. Compression of pore space and contact losses affect pressure derivatives, but these seem independent of T. Accurate (+/-2\%) values of D(T) at 1 atm are obtained with the contact-free, laser-flash method. Other optical techniques do not pinpoint D but provide useful pressure derivatives. Published data on (partial differential)(lnk)/(partial differential)P at ambient conditions agree roughly with all available models, the simplest of which predicts (partial differential)(lnk)/(partial differential)P approximately (partial differential)(lnK(T))/(partial differential)P, where K(T) is the bulk modulus. However, derivatives verified by multiple measurements are reproduced accurately only by the damped harmonic oscillator model. An improved database is needed to refine this model and to confidently extrapolate these difficult measurements to geophysically relevant conditions.},

Most predictive models show that this dynamic topography has peak amplitudes of about {\textpm}2 km, dominated by wavelengths of 104 km. Here, we test these models against our comprehensive observational database of 2,120 spot measurements of dynamic topography that were determined by analysing oceanic seismic surveys. These accurate measurements have typical peak amplitudes of {\textpm}1 km and wavelengths of approximately 103 km, and are combined with limited continental constraints to generate a global spherical harmonic model, the robustness of which has been carefully tested and benchmarked. Our power spectral analysis reveals significant discrepancies between observed and predicted dynamic topography. At longer wavelengths (such as 104 km), observed dynamic topography has peak amplitudes of about {\textpm}500 m. At shorter wavelengths (such as 103 km), significant dynamic topography is still observed. We show that these discrepancies can be explained if short-wavelength dynamic topography is generated by temperature-driven density anomalies within a sub-plate asthenospheric channel. Stratigraphic observations from adjacent continental margins show that these dynamic topographic signals evolve quickly with time. More rapid temporal and spatial changes in vertical displacement of the Earth's surface have direct consequences for fields as diverse as mantle flow, oceanic circulation and long-term climate change.},

  abstract = {Convective circulation of the mantle causes deflections of the Earth's surface that vary as a function of space and time. Accurate measurements of this dynamic topography are complicated by the need to isolate and remove other sources of elevation, arising from flexure and lithospheric isostasy. The complex architecture of continental lithosphere means that measurement of present-day dynamic topography is more straightforward in the oceanic realm. Here we present an updated methodology for calculating oceanic residual bathymetry, which is a proxy for dynamic topography. Corrections are applied that account for the effects of sedimentary loading and compaction, for anomalous crustal thickness variations, for subsidence of oceanic lithosphere as a function of age and for non-hydrostatic geoid height variations. Errors are formally propagated to estimate measurement uncertainties. We apply this methodology to a global database of 1936 seismic surveys located on oceanic crust and generate 2297 spot measurements of residual topography, including 1161 with crustal corrections. The resultant anomalies have amplitudes of {\textpm}1 km and wavelengths of {$\sim$}1000 km. Spectral analysis of our database using cross-validation demonstrates that spherical harmonics up to and including degree 30 (i.e., wavelengths down to 1300 km) are required to accurately represent these observations. Truncation of the expansion at a lower maximum degree erroneously increases the amplitude of inferred long-wavelength dynamic topography. There is a strong correlation between our observations and free-air gravity anomalies, magmatism, ridge seismicity, vertical motions of adjacent rifted margins, and global tomographic models. We infer that shorter wavelength components of the observed pattern of dynamic topography may be attributable to the presence of thermal anomalies within the shallow asthenospheric mantle.},

A pressure-dependent Landau model for order-disorder permits extension of disordering transitions to high pressures, and, in particular, allows the alpha-beta quartz transition to be handled more satisfactorily. Several melt end-members have been included to enable calculation of simple phase equilibria and as a first stage in developing melt mixing models in NCKFMASH. The simple aqueous species density model has been extended to enable speciation calculations and mineral solubility determination involving minerals and aqueous species at high temperatures and pressures. The data set has also been improved by incorporation of many new phase equilibrium constraints, calorimetric studies and new measurements of molar volume, thermal expansion and compressibility. This has led to a significant improvement in the level of agreement with the available experimental phase equilibria, and to greater flexibility in calculation of complex mineral equilibria. It is also shown that there is very good agreement between the data set and the most recent available calorimetric data.},

  abstract = {Based on observations in both the laboratory and the Earth, we develop the hypothesis that plate boundaries are lubricated by networks of melt-rich shear zones. Such lubrication would serve to reduce effective strength and focus deformation at plates boundaries. This idea emerges from two sets of observations: (1) stress-driven melt segregation and organization in experimentally deformed mantle rocks and (2) seismic anisotropy patterns as observed at three divergent plate boundaries (the Ethiopian Rift, the Reykjanes Ridge, and the East Pacific Rise). In all three tectonic settings, the magnitude of anisotropy is greatest at the probable locations of the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary within the plate boundary (\&\#8220;marginal LAB\&\#8221;). Seismic anisotropy in the upper mantle is controlled by the lattice preferred orientation (LPO) of predominant olivine and the alignment of melt structures. The observed patterns of anisotropy are controlled by the dip angle of the marginal LAB. When steeply dipping, shear wave splitting in vertically traveling waves (e.g., SKS phases) is most sensitive to the alignment of melt, and surface waves should reveal faster Rayleigh wave velocities than Love wave velocities (VSV {\textbackslash}textgreater VSH). When shallowly dipping, shear wave splitting in vertically traveling body waves is controlled by olivine LPO, and surface waves show faster Love wave velocities than Rayleigh wave velocities (VSV {\textbackslash}textless VSH). The formation of melt-rich networks by stress-driven segregation should be most effective where strain rates are highest. These melt-lubricated shear zones will reduce effective viscosity relative to the direct extrapolation of viscosity values derived from laboratory creep experiments on homogenous samples. A composite model of anisotropic seismic properties is developed to test the hypothesis that melt segregates along the LAB, incorporating olivine fabrics with oriented and segregated melt over a range of length scales. This model is applied to observations from the three example plate boundaries, leaving the reader to speculate on the implications for interpretation of anisotropy patterns at other geodynamic settings.},

  abstract = {Estimates of past climate derived from borehole temperatures are assuming a greater importance in context of the millennial temperature variation debate. However, recovery of these signals is usually performed with regularization which can potentially lead to underestimation of past variation when noise is present. In this work Bayesian inference is applied to this problem with no explicit regularization. To achieve this Reversible Jump Markov chain Monte Carlo is employed, and this allows models of varying complexity (i.e. variable dimensions) to be sampled so that it is possible to infer the level of ground surface temperature (GST) history resolution appropriate to the data. Using synthetic examples, we show that the inference of the GST signal back to more than 500 yr is robust given boreholes of 500 m depth and moderate noise levels and discuss the associated uncertainties. We compare the prior information we have used with the inferred posterior distribution to show which parts of the GST reconstructions are independent of this prior information. We demonstrate the application of the method to real data using five boreholes from southern England. These are modelled both individually and jointly, and appear to indicate a spatial trend of warming over 500 yr across the south of the country.},

In this study, we have proposed a mesh-free lattice Boltzmann method for the solution of geometrically complex fluid flow problems. The main distinction of our method is to consider the streaming equation as a pure advection equation rather than a perfect shift, so that the physical space discretization becomes independent of the lattice. We discretize the advection equation using the Lax-Wendroff scheme in time and the meshless local Petrov-Galerkin scheme based on radial basis functions in space. We first solve two benchmark problems, namely the Poiseuille flow and the lid-driven cavity flow for the validation of the proposed method, and then simulate fluid flow in a two dimensional granular porous medium. The results show that our method outperforms the conventional lattice Boltzmann method in the simulation of geometrically complicated flows.},

  abstract = {We observe that the depths of the 410 and 660. km seismic discontinuities are, on average, slightly positively correlated globally. This is due in large part to a modestly depressed 660. km discontinuity and a large depression of the 410. km discontinuity across the Pacific. The Clapeyron slope (dP/dT), the change in pressure (depth) of a phase transition with a change in temperature, can be used to predict the depth of a phase transformation assuming lateral temperature variations. The phase change of olivine to {$\beta$}-spinel is well understood experimentally, almost certainly produces the 410. km discontinuity, and has a positive Clapeyron slope. At the base of the transition zone, both the olivine component of the mantle ({$\gamma$}-spinel) and the pyroxene component (garnet) transform to perovskite and periclase. Observations of 660. km discontinuity depths are often consistent with the negative Clapeyron slope of the {$\gamma$}-spinel to perovskite and periclase transition, with an apparent anti-correlation with the depth of the 410. km discontinuity. However, under the Pacific, the depression of the 410. km discontinuity and slow seismic velocities indicate that the mantle is warmer than average. Using a negative Clapeyron slope for the perovskite-forming reaction, the 660. km discontinuity is predicted to be shallow in this region. However, we observe that it is either depressed or has little deflection from its average depth. We find that if the Clapeyron slope associated with the 660. km discontinuity changes sign from negative to positive between 1920 and 2020. K, we can explain the correlation of discontinuity structure with seismic velocities in the transition zone. This shift in sign is in accord with the dominant 660. km transition-forming reaction shifting from {$\gamma$}-spinel to garnet near this temperature. {\copyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Ocean island basalts (OIBs) are commonly related to plume volcanism, and their diverse isotopic and elemental compositions can be described using a limited number of mantle endmembers. However, the origins and depths of these mantle endmembers are highly debated. Here we show that the HIMU (high {$\mu$}, {$\mu$}=238U/204Pb) endmember may reside in the transition zone. Specifically, we report the geochemical signature of a high-pressure multiphase diamond inclusion, entrapped at 420--440 km depth and 1450 {\textpm} 50 K, which matches exactly the geochemical patterns of the HIMU-rich OIBs. Since the HIMU component is variably sampled by almost all OIBs, our finding implies that the transition zone causes a major overprint of the geochemical features of mantle plumes. Some mantle plumes, like those feeding Bermuda, St Helena, Tubuai and Mangaia, appear to be dominated by this source. Furthermore, our finding highlights the importance of the transition zone in highly incompatible element budget of the mantle.},

  abstract = {For an accurate assessment of the relative roles of natural variability and anthropogenic influence in the Earth's climate, reconstructions of past temperatures from the pre-industrial as well as the industrial period are essential. But instrumental records are typically available for no more than the past 150 years. Therefore reconstructions of pre-industrial climate rely principally on traditional climate proxy records, each with particular strengths and limitations in representing climatic variability. Subsurface temperatures comprise an independent archive of past surface temperature changes that is complementary to both the instrumental record and the climate proxies. Here we use present-day temperatures in 616 boreholes from all continents except Antarctica to reconstruct century-long trends in temperatures over the past 500 years at global, hemispheric and continental scales. The results confirm the unusual warming of the twentieth century revealed by the instrumental record, but suggest that the cumulative change over the past five centuries amounts to about 1 K, exceeding recent estimates from conventional climate proxies. The strength of temperature reconstructions from boreholes lies in the detection of long-term trends, complementary to conventional climate proxies, but to obtain a complete picture of past warming, the differences between the approaches need to be investigated in detail.},

  abstract = {We present results from a suite of forward transient numerical modelling experiments of the British and Irish Ice Sheet (BIIS), consisting of Scottish, Welsh and Irish accumulation centres, spanning the last Glacial period from 38 to 10 ka BP. The 3D thermomechanical model employed uses higher-order physics to solve longitudinal (membrane) stresses and to reproduce grounding-line dynamics. Surface mass balance is derived using a distributed degree-day calculation based on a reference climatology from mean (1961-1990) precipitation and temperature patterns. The model is perturbed from this reference state by a scaled NGRIP oxygen isotope curve and the SPECMAP sea-level reconstruction. Isostatic response to ice loading is computed using an elastic lithosphere/relaxed asthenosphere scheme. A suite of 350 simulations were designed to explore the parameter space of model uncertainties and sensitivities, to yield a subset of experiments that showed close correspondence to offshore and onshore ice-directional indicators, broad BIIS chronology, and the relative sea-level record. Three of these simulations are described in further detail and indicate that the separate ice centres of the modelled BIIS complex are dynamically interdependent during the build up to maximum conditions, but remain largely independent throughout much of the simulation. The modelled BIIS is extremely dynamic, drained mainly by a number of transient but recurrent ice streams which dynamically switch and fluctuate in extent and intensity on a centennial time-scale. A series of binge/purge, advance/retreat, cycles are identified which correspond to alternating periods of relatively cold-based ice, (associated with a high aspect ratio and net growth), and wet-based ice with a lower aspect ratio, characterised by streaming. The timing and dynamics of these events are determined through a combination of basal thermomechanical switching spatially propagated and amplified through longitudinal coupling, but are modulated and phase-lagged to the oscillations within the NGRIP record of climate forcing. Phases of predominant streaming activity coincide with periods of maximum ice extent and are triggered by abrupt transitions from a cold to relatively warm climate, resulting in major iceberg/melt discharge events into the North Sea and Atlantic Ocean. The broad chronology of the modelled BIIS indicates a maximum extent at {$\sim$}20 ka, with fast-flowing ice across its western and northern sectors that extended to the continental shelf edge. Fast-flowing streams also dominate the Irish Sea and North Sea Basin sectors and impinge onto SW England and East Anglia. From {$\sim$}19 ka BP deglaciation is achieved in less than 2000 years, discharging the freshwater equivalent of {$\sim$}2 m global sea-level rise. A much reduced ice sheet centred on Scotland undergoes subsequent retrenchment and a series of advance/retreat cycles into the North Sea Basin from 17 ka onwards, culminating in a sustained Younger Dryas event from 13 to 11.5 ka BP. Modelled ice cover is persistent across the Western and Central Highlands until the last remnant glaciers disappear around 10.5 ka BP. {\copyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Here slab dip angles and subduction parameters, including subduction duration, the nature of the overriding plate, slab age and convergence rate, are determined for 153 transects along subduction zones for the present-day. We present a comprehensive tabulation of subduction duration based on isotopic ages of arc initiation and stratigraphic, structural, plate tectonic and seismic indicators of subduction initiation. We present two ages for subduction zones, a long-term age and a reinitiation age. Using cross correlation and multivariate regression, we find that: (1) subduction duration is the primary parameter controlling slab dips with slabs tending to have shallower dips at subduction zones that have been in existence longer; (2) the long-term age of subduction duration better explains variation of shallow dip than reinitiation age; (3) overriding plate nature could influence shallow dip angle, where slabs below continents tend to have shallower dips; (4) slab age contributes to slab dip, with younger slabs having steeper shallow dips; and (5) the relations between slab dip and subduction parameters are depth-dependent, where the ability of subduction duration and overriding plate nature to explain observed variation decreases with depth. The analysis emphasizes the importance of subduction history and the long-term regional state of a subduction zone in determining slab dip and are consistent with mechanical models of subduction.}

In particular, the perturbations associated with sedimentation and surface temperature changes must be taken into account. Analytical solutions can be obtained only for individual, simplified versions of these problems, whereas any real example is complicated by the process of sediment compaction which changes the bulk thermal properties with depth. A physical model is developed which uses sediment porosity trends to predict the thermal parameters and material advection rates for an evolving sediment/basement system. These values are then used in a numerical solution to the heat flow equation to give estimates of the perturbed surface heat flux through time. In addition to variations in sedimentation rate, sediment type, radioactive heat production and surface temperature changes are considered. Heat flow corrections may vary by up to a factor of 2 according to sediment type while radioactive heat production can offset the effects of sedimentation by as much as 40 per cent. The results also indicate that alterations determined from simple analytical models tend to over-estimate the true perturbation to the flux. 1},

This multidisciplinary study describes the burial and exhumation history of the frontier Galilee Basin in central Queensland, Australia, with implications for understanding its geohistory and unconventional gas prospectivity. Seismic interpretation, stratigraphic mapping, and an analysis of exhumation through quantifying overcompaction show total subsidence of approximately 2 km ({$\sim$}6600 ft) from the Carboniferous to the Late Cretaceous, punctuated by two major exhumation events. Triassic exhumation was less than 600 m ( {\textbackslash}textless 1970 ft), whereas Late Cretaceous exhumation was in the order of 1000 m (3300 ft), increasing eastward to greater than 1600 m (5250 ft). Geohistory reconstructions show that Permian coal measures generated up to 45 m 3 /t (1590 ft 3 /t) of gas when modeled temperatures exceeded 100{$^\circ$}C (210{$^\circ$}F) during maximum burial of 1.5-2 km (4920-6560 ft) in the Late Cretaceous. In the Carboniferous to the mid-Cretaceous, the basin was situated to the west of the Eastern Australian subduction zone, where proto-Pacific oceanic lithosphere was subducted until circa 100 Ma, when subduction ceased. Our study shows that the geohistory of the basin is characterized by rapid subsidence of 50 m/m.y. (165 ft/m.y.) followed by rebound at circa 95 Ma resulting in an uplift and erosion phase. The undersaturation of the coals at present day is explained by this uplift event. Carbon isotopes indicate that the remaining gas ( {\textbackslash}textless 8 m 3 /t [ {\textbackslash}textless 280 ft 3 /t]) is of mixed biogenic and thermogenic origin. Therefore, dynamic surface topography driven by subduction dynamics and slab breakoff had a profound effect on the subsidence, uplift, and resource potential of the Galilee Basin.}

Steady state solutions have been applied to estimate both aquifer scale fluxes as well as to estimate groundwater discharge to streams. This study explores the sources of uncertainty in flux estimates from regional scale aquifers caused by sensor precision, aquifer heterogeneity, multidimensional flow and variations in surface temperature due to climate change. Synthetic temperature profiles were generated using 2-D groundwater flow and heat transport models with homogeneous and heterogeneous hydraulic and thermal properties. Temperature profiles were analyzed assuming temperature can be determined with a precision between 0.1{$^\circ$}C and 0.001{$^\circ$}C. Analysis of synthetic temperature profiles show that the Bredehoeft and Papadopulos (1965) method can provide good estimates of the mean vertical Darcy flux over the length of the temperature profile. Reliable flux estimates were obtained when the ratio of vertical to horizontal flux was as low as 0.1, and in heterogeneous media, providing that temperature at the upper boundary was constant in time. However, temporal increases in surface temperature led to over-estimation of fluxes. Overestimates increased with time since the onset of, and with the rate of surface warming. Overall, the Bredehoeft and Papadopulos (1965) method may be more robust for the conditions with constant temperature distributions than previously thought, but that transient methods that account for surface warming should be used to determine fluxes in shallow aquifers.},

We examine this rheological effect on mantle flow and melting of a ridge-centered mantle plume using three-dimensional numerical models. Results indicate that the viscosity increase associated with dehydration prevents buoyancy forces from contributing significantly to plume upwelling above the dry solidus. Consequently, upwelling in the primary melting zone is driven passively by plate spreading and melt production rates are substantially lower than predicted by models that do not include the rheological effect of dehydration. Predictions of along-axis crustal thickness, bathymetric, and gravity variations are shown to be consistent with observations at Iceland and along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Furthermore, these predictions result from a model of a plume with relatively high excess temperature (180{$^\circ$}C) and narrow radius (100 km) - properties that are consistent with estimates previously inferred from geochemical and seismological observations. Calculations of incompatible trace-element concentrations suggest that observed along-axis geochemical anomalies primarily reflect incompatible element heterogeneity of the plume source.},

The technology is focused on drilling better wells and improving reservoir management, thus increasing the poor 30--35\% average reservoir recovery factor. It is used to extend the peak-flow plateau of the reservoir, deliver low-cost reserves additions, and make better use of topsides facilities. 4D is one of the few technologies that can show what is happening between wells. Its take-up was accelerated by the tendency of reservoir flow rates to come off-peak quickly and unexpectedly, requiring urgent improvements in the understanding of the reservoir. 4D technology led to improved well success rates and produced net-present-value (NPV) figures that were easily eight to 10 times the cost of the 4D seismic itself. It became commonplace to re-record 4D surveys at intervals of between two and five years. The technology has improved markedly since its early use, with nonrepeatability metrics falling from 40\% or more down to single figures. It is most effective if conducted early in the reservoir's life and, subsequently, prior to reservoir management changes such as commencement of injection. On large reservoirs, 4D is generally routine, although it is also used on small reservoirs with 30 million bbl remaining reserves or less. Emplaced systems with frequent reshoots have been implemented on some reservoirs. Challenges include 4D on land, hard rock reservoirs, pressure response detection, and incorporation of geomechanical models. The 2015--2017 market downturn has slowed the extension of emplaced systems and other ``broadband'' techniques for 4D, but new technologies will move into this market, at reduced cost, so the future is full of opportunities.},

We analyse the disaster as a crisis of modern water within the hydrosocial cycle framework formulated by Linton and Budds. Using archival analysis we identify four phases in the emergence and transformation of modern water in the Murray-Darling Basin generally and the lower Darling specifically; navigation flows (1850--1900s), entitlement flows (1880--1940s), exchange water (1950--1990s) and saved water (2000s-present). The phases are driven by conceptual abstraction and commensuration, leading in turn to the material abstraction of water from the lower Darling, rendering the river and its communities vulnerable. We reveal three previously unidentified social processes contributing to the current crisis. First, the development of a model of hydrological productivity that rationalised the Basin scale as a unit of governance and deemed some places `effective' and others, like the Darling, `ineffective'. Second, an early form of offsetting in `exchange water' that disembedded water at least three decades before market environmentalism took hold. Third, accounting technologies that enrol evaporative water into basin water governance and politics. A crisis like the fish kills reveals the ways in which the hydrological cycle overflows with social content, internalising scientific expertise and dominant modes of water governance that include settler colonialism. However, hydrosocial framings need to better capture the diversity and complexity of co-existing Indigenous ontologies, and their different expressions of the social and experiences of the material. These ontologies both intersect with and exceed modern water.}

  abstract = {Substantial progress is reported towards a reconciliation of experimental observations of high-temperature viscoelastic behaviour of fine-grained materials with the micromechanical theory of grain-boundary sliding. The classic Raj--Ashby theory of grain boundary sliding has recently been revisited -- confirming the presence of the following features: (i) at a characteristic period {$\tau$}e much less than the Maxwell relaxation time {$\tau$}d, a dissipation peak of amplitude {$\sim$}10-2 and associated shear modulus relaxation resulting from elastically accommodated sliding on grain boundaries of relatively low viscosity; (ii) at intermediate periods, a broad regime of diffusionally-assisted grain-boundary sliding within which the dissipation varies with period as Q-1{$\sim$}To{$\alpha$} with {$\alpha\sim$}1/3, sliding being limited by stress concentrations at grain corners, that are progressively eroded with increasing period and diffusion distance; and (iii) for periods longer than the Maxwell relaxation time {$\tau$}d, diffusionally accommodated grain-boundary sliding with Q-1{$\sim$}To. For periods To{$\gg\tau$}e, laboratory dissipation data may be adequately described as a function of a single master variable, namely the normalised period To/{$\tau$}d. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that the lower levels of dissipation measured at shorter periods deviate from such a master curve -- consistent with the existence of the two characteristic timescales, {$\tau$}e and {$\tau$}d, for grain-boundary sliding, with distinct grain-size sensitivities. New forced-oscillation data at moderate temperatures (short normalised periods) provide tentative evidence of the dissipation peak of elastically accommodated sliding. Complementary torsional microcreep data indicate that, at seismic periods of 1--1000s, much of the non-elastic strain is recoverable -- consistent with substantial contributions from elastically accommodated and diffusionally assisted grain-boundary sliding.},

  abstract = {Subduction of continental and oceanic crust is thought to give rise to geochemically distinct reservoirs in the mantle called EM (enriched mantle) and HIMU (high {$\mu$} = 238U/204Pb), respectively. However, the locations of EM and HIMU domains in the Earth's interior are poorly constrained. We explore the geographic distribution of extreme EM (143Nd/144Nd {$\leq$} 0.512630) and HIMU (206Pb/204Pb {$\geq$} 20) geochemical signatures in ocean island basalts erupted at hot spots, highlighting three observations. First, hot spots geographically associated with the two large low shear wave velocity provinces (LLSVPs) have a similar range of EM compositions. If these hot spots are sourced by the LLSVPs via upwelling plumes, this observation is consistent with the hypothesis that the LLSVPs formed by similar processes and have similar geodynamic histories. Second, the EM and HIMU domains exhibit different latitudinal zonation: oceanic hot spots with the most extreme EM compositions (143Nd/144Nd {\textbackslash}textless 0.5125) are concentrated in the Southern Hemisphere (14{$^\circ$}S to 52{$^\circ$}S latitude), while oceanic hot spots hosting HIMU compositions are found primarily near the tropical latitudes (38{$^\circ$}N to 29{$^\circ$}S). Third, all 13 oceanic hot spots with EM compositions (143Nd/144Nd {$\leq$} 0.512630) are geographically associated with the LLSVPs; oceanic hot spots located far from the LLSVPs exhibit only non-EM (143Nd/144Nd {\textbackslash}textgreater 0.512630) compositions. In contrast, the HIMU domains do not show a clear geographic association with the LLSVPs. Therefore, EM and HIMU domains in the Earth's mantle exhibit different spatial distributions. This may reflect differences in subduction inputs of these two components, or differences in how they segregate or accumulate in the deep Earth.},

Both the shear modulus, which governs the shear wave speed Vs, and the dissipation of shear strain energy Q-1 have been measured as functions of oscillation period To, temperature T, and, for the first time, grain size. At sufficiently high T all for specimens display similar absorption band viscoelastic behavior, adequately represented for 1000 {\textbackslash}textless T {\textbackslash}textless 1200 or 1300C and 1 {\textbackslash}textless To {\textbackslash}textless 100 s, by the expression Q-1 = A Tod-1 exp (-E/RT)? with A = 7.5 102 s-? ?m?, = 0.26 and E = 424 kJ mol-1. This mildly grain-size-sensitive viscoelastic behavior of melt-free polycrystalline olivine is attributed to a combination of elastically and diffusionally accomodated grain boundary sliding, the latter becoming progressively more important with increasing T and/or To. Extrapolation to the larger (mm-cm) grain sizes expected in the Earth's upper mantle yields levels of dissipation comparable with those observed seismologically, implying that the same grain-size-sensitive processes might be responsible for much of the observed seismic wave attenuation. The temperature sensitivity of Vs is increased substantially by the viscoelastic relaxation allowing the lateral variability of wave speeds to be associated with relatively small temperature perturbations.},

The overall deformation in the zone is described by the deformation gradient tensor L, which may be split into a symmetric part, S,and an antisymmetric part, A. S is the strain tensor, and can always be determined from the sum of the moment tensors, following the result of Kostrov (1974). A corresponds to a rigid body rotation, and is in principle unobservable seismically: the moment tensors contain no information about A, regardless of whether the ambiguity between fault and auxiliary planes is resolved. From S the integrated rates of motion normal and parallel to the zone boundary, as well as vertically, can be calculated. Of these, only the motion normal to the zone is specified by the motion across its boundaries. In general, S (and hence L) is not specified by the motion of the plates bounding the zone. Only if some a priori assumptions about L are made, can information about A be recovered from the seismic moment tensors. Otherwise A must be determined independently from paleomagnetic or geodetic measurements.},

Recordings were made from three shot points at the southwest of the line and from 31 shot points of the Durham programme in the North Irish Sea. A crustal model is presented which is based exclusively on a travel-time interpretation. The Pg velocities recorded in eastern Ireland rise quite rapidly with depth to 6.3--6.5 km/s but in the western part of the profile lower velocities between 6.0 and 6.3 km/s were recorded. Prominent energy in later arrivals can be correlated by two reflected phases from a mid-crustal boundary and the Moho. A low-velocity zone is present at the northeastern end of the line and a mid-crustal layer with an average velocity of about 6.4 km/s is separated from the lower crust, mean velocity 6.8 km/s, by a well established mid-crustal boundary zone of 1--2 km thickness at about 20 km depth. The Moho, around 32 km at its deepest, shallows towards the sea at both ends of the line. It is a sharp discontinuity under western Ireland but a transition zone of 3--4 km thickness in the east. An interpretation is given which takes into account 1.(a) the geologic and tectonic history of Ireland and2.(b) data derived from the gravity and magnetic fields.}

  abstract = {The thermal structure and evolution of continents depend strongly on the amount and distribution of radioactive heat sources in the crust. Determining the contribution of crustal rocks beneath a superficial layer is a major challenge because heat production depends weakly on major element composition and physical properties such as seismic wavespeed and density. Enriched granitic intrusives that lie at the current erosion level have a large impact on the surface heat flux but little influence on temperatures in the deep crust. Many lower crustal rocks that are poor in heat producing elements are restites from ancient orogenic events, implying that enrichment of the upper crust was achieved at the expense of deeper crustal levels. For the same total heat production, concentrating heat sources in an upper layer acts to reduce temperatures in the lower crust, thereby allowing stabilization of the crust. The present-day structure of the crust is a consequence of orogeny and should not be adopted for thermal models of the orogenic event itself. This review summarizes information extracted from large data sets on heat flow and heat production and provides estimates of crustal stratification and heat production in several geological provinces. Analysis of global and regional data sets reveals the absence of a positive correlation between surface heat flow and crustal thickness, showing that the average crustal heat production is not constant. Differences of heat flow between geological provinces are due in large part to changes of crustal structure and bulk composition. Collating values of the bulk crustal heat production in a few age intervals reveals a clear trend of decrease with increasing age. This trend can be accounted for by radioactive decay, indicating that thermal conditions at the time of crustal stabilization have not changed significantly. For the average crustal thickness of 40 km, Moho temperatures are near solidus values at the time of stabilization, suggesting an intrinsic thermal control on crustal thickness and heat production distribution. Crustal thickening by more than about 10 km above this mean value induces changes of gravitational potential energy that exceed the strength of the lithosphere. For several provinces where strong constraints on heat production are available, it is shown that, prior to intracrustal fractionation, only modest amounts of thickening were needed to generate the conditions of ultra-high temperature metamorphism. The tell-tale signature of crustal heat production is anatectic and metamorphic events that lag the cessation of orogenic activity by several tens of million years. Crustal heat production is decreasing with time because it is due to the radioactive decay of Uranium Thorium and Potassium. Its rundown is responsible for the secular cooling of lithospheric roots at a typical rate of about 100 K Gy - 1, implying complex thermal interactions with a convecting mantle that is not cooling at the same rate.},

  abstract = {The Mount Lofty Ranges, Fleurieu Peninsula and Kangaroo Island regions of South Australia expose a section across the west and northwestern margin of the southern Adelaide Fold Belt that was deformed and metamorphosed during the Cambro-Ordovician Delamerian Orogeny. In the external parts of the belt, thrust complexes involving basement and a late Proterozoic platformal succession show a characteristic asymmetry reflecting west to northwest vergence towards the Australian craton. In the more internal zones, convergent deformation involving large-scale upright folding and high-T, low-P metamorphism of mainly Cambrian sediments, which were in part turbiditic, occurred between c. 516 and c. 490 Ma. In this part of the belt the distribution of heat and, possibly, strain reflects intimately the advective movement of magmas within the orogenic belt. Convergent deformation in the southern Adelaide Fold Belt was immediately preceded by rapid subsidence initiated during the deposition of the upper parts of the Normanville Group and which continued during deposition of the Kanmantoo Group. Mafic alkaline volcanism attendant with Normanville Group deposition is indicative of lithospheric thinning at c. 526 Ma.}

  abstract = {The inversion of multiple geoscientific datasets to define structures in hard rock terrains has for the most part been limited to geophysical methods supported by rock property constraints. In this paper we expand the range of constraints available to geological modellers by defining a series of misfit functions that are used to define the quality of a given geological model with respect to the available geological data. These misfit functions encompass both spatial and temporal observations, and include primary data such as the location of an outcrop or bore hole location of a given rock type, the orientation of its different generations of foliations, as well as secondary geologic observations such as age relationships. When we combine geologic conditions with geophysical misfit functions, which already exist for many geophysical measures, we have the potential to better constrain two- and 3D models of the Earth. As a first test, a subset of these misfit functions are applied to a set of synthetic three-dimensional volumetric models built with an implicit surface modelling scheme. By perturbing the input structural data within a narrow range, we can simulate a range of significantly different three-dimensional models, for which we can then apply both geological and geophysical misfit functions. Several joint geological/geophysical inversion schemes may be developed based on this methodology, with the ultimate goal being an inversion scheme that simultaneously minimizes both geological and geophysical misfit.},

Here we investigate the lithospheric structure of Venus by calculating its crustal and effective elastic thicknesses (Tc and Te, respectively) from an analysis of gravity and topography, in order to improve our knowledge of the large scale and long-term mechanical behaviour of its lithosphere. We find that the venusian crust is usually 20--25 km thick with thicker crust under the highlands. Our effective elastic thickness values range between 14 km (corresponding to the minimum resolvable Te value) and 94 km, but are dominated by low to moderate values. Te variations deduced from our model could represent regional variations in the cooling history of the lithosphere and/or mantle processes with limited surface manifestation. The crustal plateaus are near-isostatically compensated, consistent with a thin elastic lithosphere, showing a thickened crust beneath them, whereas the lowlands exhibit higher Te values, maybe indicating a cooler lithosphere than that when the venusian highlands were emplaced. The large volcanic rises show a complex signature, with a broad range of Te and internal load fraction (F) values. Finally, our results also reveal a significant contribution of the upper mantle to the strength of the lithosphere in many regions.},

One approach consists in first applying a semi-discretization in time by a fully implicit \${\th}eta\$-scheme. Then, in each discrete time, the equations are linearized by a fixed point iteration. The number of iterations to reach a given stopping criterion is a priori unknown in this approach. In the second approach, Rosenbrock schemes with s stages are used as temporal discretization. The non-linearity of the Navier-Stokes equations is treated internally in the Rosenbrock methods. In each discrete time, exactly s linear systems of equations have to be solved. The numerical study considers five two-dimensional problems with distinct features. Four implicit time stepping schemes and five Rosenbrock methods are involved. {\copyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Through comparison of the tectonic and kinematic records of the last 50 Ma with seismic tomography and anisotropy models, we show that the closure of the former Tethys Ocean and the extensional deformation of East Asia can be best explained if the asthenospheric mantle transporting India northward, forming the Himalaya and the Tibetan Plateau, reaches East Asia where it overrides the westward flowing Pacific mantle and contributes to subduction dynamics, distributing extensional deformation over a 3,000-km wide region. This deep asthenospheric flow partly controls the compressional stresses transmitted through the continent-continent collision, driving crustal thickening below the Himalayas and Tibet and the propagation of strike-slip faults across Asian lithosphere further north and east, as well as with the lithospheric and crustal flow powered by slab retreat east of the collision zone below East and SE Asia. The main shortening direction in the deforming continent between the collision zone and the Pacific subduction zones may in this case be a proxy for the direction of flow in the asthenosphere underneath, which may become a useful tool for studying mantle flow in the distant past. Our model of the India-Asia collision emphasizes the role of asthenospheric flow underneath continents and may offer alternative ways of understanding tectonic processes.},

The magnitude of Cenozoic magmatism is therefore greater than previously thought, necessitating a re-evaluation of basalt distribution and estimates of eruptive volumes. Drill-hole data were collected from across the Bowen Basin in eastern Australia to compile a regional basalt isopach map. This large dataset comprising ?150 000 drill-hole logs was used to derive minimum extrusive volume estimates of the Peak Range, Springsure and Buckland volcanoes of approximately 2600 km3, 1460 km3 and 860 km3, respectively. The southward decrease in the volumes of these volcanoes, as well as a southward diminishing pattern of eruption rate, most likely arose from waning plume magmatism. We estimate that from ca 30 Ma (the average age of the Peak Range volcano in Queensland) to ca 10 Ma (the approximate age of the Canobolas volcano in New South Wales), the eruption rate in the east Australian central volcanoes decreased by roughly 15 km3/Ma. Additionally, our dataset suggests that basalt flows in portions of eastern Australia filled pre-existing channels with maximum depths ranging from 60 to 220 m, implying an early- to mid-Cenozoic topography of moderate relief.},

The former group is typically ascribed to the Cenozoic northward motion of Australia over fixed thermal anomalies in the mantle (i.e., ``hotspots''), while the latter group is traditionally attributed to the opening of the Tasman and Coral Seas, though more recent interpretations have linked its formation to edge-driven convection or other processes. However, the initial criteria used to define the groups based on morphological and lithological features are neither robust nor consistently able to be applied to individual provinces. Despite their importance in the Cenozoic tectonic history of eastern Australia and, more broadly, the SW Pacific, geochemical distinctions between the two groups have been underexplored. Based on examination of an extensive database of new and previous major element, trace element, and radiogenic isotope data and principal component analysisfrom key volcanic exposures in Queensland and New South Wales, we find no systematic geochemical differences between the two groups. Both age-progressive and non-age-progressive Cenozoic mafic volcanic rocks in eastern Australia have an EM1-like source signature that could have originated in the asthenosphere and interacted with SCLM upon ascent. Our work underpins the necessity of understanding the magma generation mechanisms and the geodynamic context of individual volcanoes across eastern Australia.},

  abstract = {Modeling the continental lithosphere's physical properties, especially its depth extent, must be done within a self-consistent petrological--geophysical framework; modeling using only one or two data types may easily lead to inconsistencies and erroneous interpretations. Using the LitMod approach for hypothesis testing and first-order modeling, we show how assumptions made about crustal information and the probable compositions of the lithospheric and sub-lithospheric mantle affect particular observables, particularly especially surface topographic elevation. The critical crustal parameter is density, leading to ca. 600m error in topography for 50kgm-3 imprecision. The next key parameter is crustal thickness, and uncertainties in its definition lead to around ca. 4km uncertainty in LAB for every 1km of variation in Moho depth. Possible errors in the other assumed crustal parameters introduce a few kilometers of uncertainty in the depth to the LAB. We use Ireland as a natural laboratory to demonstrate the approach. From first-order arguments and given reasonable assumptions, a topographic elevation in the range of 50--100m, which is the average across Ireland, requires that the lithosphere--asthenosphere boundary (LAB) beneath most of Ireland must lie in the range 90--115km. A somewhat shallower (to 85km) LAB is permitted, but the crust must be thinned ({\textbackslash}textless29km) to compensate. The observations, especially topography, are inconsistent with suggestions, based on interpretation of S-to-P receiver functions, that the LAB thins from 85km in southern Ireland to 55km in central northern Ireland over a distance of {\textbackslash}textless150km. Such a thin lithosphere would result in over 1000m of uplift, and such rapid thinning by 30km over less than 150km would yield significant north--south variations in topographic elevation, Bouguer anomaly, and geoid height, none of which are observed. Even juxtaposing the most extreme probable depleted composition for the lithospheric mantle beneath southern Ireland against the most extreme fertile composition beneath northern Ireland only allows some 20km of LAB variation; any further variations would produce effects that are well beyond those observed. One model that satisfies almost all the extant data to first order includes a spinel-peridotite upper lithospheric mantle layer to 85km in southern Ireland and to 55km in northern Ireland, thinning over a lateral distance of 150km. Below this in southern Ireland is a garnet peridotite layer extending down to 115km, and in northern Ireland a refertilized layer down to 95km. The mid-lithospheric chemical discontinuity (MLD) at the base of the Spinel Peridotite zone may explain the observed discontinuity in S-to-P (Sp) receiver functions.},

  abstract = {The Cenozoic development of the North Atlantic province has been dramatically influenced by the behaviour of the Iceland Plume, whose striking dominance is manifest by long-wavelength free-air gravity anomalies and by oceanic bathymetric anomalies. Here, we use these anomalies to estimate the amplitude and wavelength of present-day dynamic uplift associated with this plume. Maximum dynamic support in the North Atlantic is 1.5-2 km at Iceland itself. Most of Greenland is currently experiencing dynamic support of 0.5-1 km, whereas the NW European shelf is generally supported by {\textbackslash}textless0.5 km. The proto-Iceland Plume had an equally dramatic effect on the Early Cenozoic palaeogeography of the North Atlantic margins, as we illustrate with a study of plume-related uplift, denudation and sedimentation on the continental shelf encompassing Britain and Ireland. We infer that during Paleocene time a hot subvertical sheet of asthenosphere welled up beneath an axis running from the Faroes through the Irish Sea towards Lundy, generating a welt of magmatic underplating of the crust which is known to exist beneath this axis. Transient and permanent uplift associated with this magmatic injection caused regional denudation, and consequently large amounts of clastic sediment have been shed into surrounding basins during Cenozoic time. Mass balance calculations indicate agreement between the volume of denuded material and the volume of Cenozoic sediments deposited offshore in the northern North Sea Basin and the Rockall Trough. The volume of material denuded from Britain and Ireland is probably insufficient to account for the sediment in the Faroe-Shetland Basin and an excess of sediment has been supplied to the Porcupine Basin. We emphasize the value of combining observations from both oceanic and continental realms to elucidate the evolution of the Iceland Plume through space and time.},

  abstract = {Segmentation of oceanic crust by fracture zones is controlled both by asthenosphere temperature and by spreading geometry at the time of crustal formation. South of Iceland, young crust adjacent to the Reykjanes Ridge and old crust adjacent to the continental margins is smooth and unsegmented, while intermediate age crust is segmented. The older part of the boundary between segmented and unsegmented crust is coincident with magnetic chron 17 (end Middle Eocene time) and was principally controlled by a coeval change in spreading obliquity of 30{$^\circ$}. The younger part of the boundary has moved outwards from Iceland by 500 km between Late Eocene time and the present. The shape of this diachronous part of the boundary is principally controlled by asthenosphere temperature and probably records the position of a critical asthenosphere isotherm in the head of the Iceland Plume. The planform geometry of the diachronous boundary is well matched by a scaling law which predicts the spread of hot plume material along the ridge (or 'waist width') if the Iceland Plume is assumed fixed relative to other Indo-Atlantic hotspots. This match suggests that the apparent increase in the size of the Iceland Plume head since Late Eocene time can be explained by westward migration of the Reykjanes Ridge relative to the centre of a plume of constant flux on timescales over 8 Myr. Comparison of observed and predicted waist widths provides a constraint on plume volume flux and allows a direct first-order comparison between Iceland and Hawaiian Plume fluxes. {\copyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract = {Effects of pressure on high-temperature, dislocation creep in olivine ((Mg, Fe)(2)SiO4) aggregates have been determined under both water-poor ('dry') and water-saturated ('wet') conditions. New experimental data were obtained at pressures of 1-2 GPa under 'dry' and 'wet' conditions using a newly developed high-resolution dislocation density measurement technique to estimate the creep strength. These data are compared with previous data at lower and higher pressures to determine the pressure dependence of high-temperature dislocation creep in olivine aggregates. We find that the creep strength or under 'dry' conditions increases monotonically with increasing pressure, whereas the creep strength under 'wet' conditions changes with pressure in a non-monotonic fashion: it first decreases rapidly with increasing pressure and then becomes less sensitive to pressure at above I GPa. Such behaviour can be described by the following formula: {\textbackslash}textless(\&epsilon;) over dot{\textbackslash}textgreater(d,w) = A(d,w)f(H2O)(r) (T,P) exp (-(E-d,w(*) + PVd,w*)/RT) sigma(n), where the subscripts d and w refer to parameters for 'dry' and 'wet' conditions respectively. The present study gives A(d) = 10(6.1) (+/- 0.2) s(-1) (MPa)(-n), E-d(*) = 510 +/- 30 kJ mol(-1), V-d(*) = 14 +/- 2 cm(3) mol(-1) and r = 0 for 'dry' d conditions, and A(w) = 10(2.9 +/-) (0.1) s(-1) (MPa)(-n-r), E-w(*) 470 +/- 40 kJ mol(-1), V-w(*) = 24 +/- 3 cm(3) mol(-1) and r = 1.20 +/- 0.05 for 'wet' conditions (n = 3.0 +/- 0.1 for both 'dry' and 'wet' conditions). The large activation volume for 'wet' conditions can be interpreted as due to the additional contribution from the activation volume for dissolution of OH in the olivine structure (V-OH(*) approximate to 11cm(3) mol(-1)). The value of r(approximate to 1.2) is consistent with a model in which creep in olivine is rate controlled by the motion of positively charged jogs through the diffusion of silicon via an interstitial mechanism.},

The conu'ibution from anelasticity is shown to be important in the Earth's mantle particularly for shear waves. In the low Q (Qla {$\sim$} 100) regions in the upper mantle, the correction due to anelasticity will roughly double the temperature derivatives due to anharmonicity alone. The correction for anelasticity will also be important in the deep mantle where Q is larger, if temperature derivatives due to anharmonicity will decrease significantly with pressure. These results imply that the temperature anomalies associated with low velocity anomalies in the mantle will be significantly smaller than previously considered on the basis of anharmonic effect alone and that the amplitude of velocity anomalies will be significantly larger for shear waves than for compressional waves.},

  abstract = {Variations in water (hydrogen) content in Earth's (upper) mantle can be inferred from geophysical observations if the relationship between water content and relevant physical properties is known and if high-resolution geophysical measurements are available. This paper reviews the current status of mineral physics understanding of the effects of water on elastic and non-elastic deformation of minerals such as olivine and its influence on seismologically measurable properties. Important effects of water on seismic wave propagation are through indirect effects due to hydrogen-related defects in nominally anhydrous minerals as opposed to the direct effects caused by the formation of hydrous minerals. Two cases of indirect effects are reviewed: (i) effects through the enhancement of anelasticity and (ii) effects through the modifications of lattice preferred orientation. The former causes enhanced attenuation (low Q) and low velocities by the increase of water content and the latter modifies the nature of seismic anisotropy. Experimental data are reviewed to formulate ways to infer water content from seismological data and analytical equations are derived that relate velocity and attenuation anomalies to anomalies in temperature and/or water content. The results are applied to infer the distribution of water in Earth's upper mantle using seismological observations. In subduction zones, the regions of high water content in the shallow upper mantle (200 km) are inferred to be localized to the mantle beneath current or recent volcanoes although wider distribution is hinted in the deeper portions (200 km). In the upper mantle beneath hot spot volcanoes such as Hawaii and Iceland, both seismic wave attenuation and anisotropy measurements suggest the presence of a column of material with a high water content, indicating that Hawaii and Iceland are not only hot spots but also wet spots.}

However, such fundamental issues as the dominant mechanisms of flow have not been well resolved. A synthesis of laboratory studies and geophysical and geological observations shows that transitions between diffusion and dislocation creep likely occur in the Earth's upper mantle. The hot and shallow upper mantle flows by dislocation creep, whereas cold and shallow or deep upper mantle may flow by diffusion creep. When the stress increases, grain size is reduced and the upper mantle near the transition between these two regimes is weakened. Consequently, deformation is localized and the upper mantle is decoupled mechanically near these depths.}

The CESM/DART should be viewed as a flexible system to support the DA needs of the CESM research community and not as a static reanalysis product. In this implementation of the CESM/DART, conventional insitu observations of the ocean and atmosphere are assimilated into the respective component models of the CESM using a 30-member ensemble adjustment Kalman filter (EAKF). CESM/DART is run in a ``weakly coupled'' configuration wherein observations native to each climate system component only directly impact the state vector for that component. Information is passed between components indirectly through the short-term coupled model forecasts that provide the EAKF background ensemble. This system leverages previous ensemble DA development for the Community Atmosphere Model and Parallel Ocean Program models using the DART EAKF. The CESM/DART project is a step towards providing increasingly useful DA capabilities for the CESM research community. Results are presented for our prototype 12-year reanalysis, run from 1970 to mid 1982. Multiple lines of evidence demonstrate that the system is capable of constraining the CESM coupled model to simulate the historical variability of the climate system in the well-observed Northern Hemisphere. A collection of monthly average variables, climate mode indices, observation diagnostics and snapshots of synoptic weather in the ocean and atmosphere are compared to established datasets, showing especially good agreement in the Northern Hemisphere. A discussion of the CESM/DART as a modular, community facility and the benefits and challenges associated with this vision is also included.},

How this melt is extracted and focused to the volcanoes, however, remains an unresolved question. Here we present new theoretical results with implications for melt focusing beneath mid-ocean ridges. By modelling laboratory experiments, we test a formulation for magma dynamics and provide an explanation for localized bands of high-porosity and concentrated shear deformation observed in experiments. These bands emerge and persist at 15 degrees-25 degrees to the plane of shear. Past theoretical work on this system predicted the emergence of melt bands but at an angle inconsistent with experiments. Our results suggest that the observed band angle results from a balance of porosity-weakening and strain-rate-weakening deformation mechanisms. Lower band angles are predicted for greater strain-rate weakening. From these lower band angles, we estimate the orientation of melt bands beneath mid-ocean ridges and show that they may enhance magma focusing toward the ridge axis.},

Whereas previous studies concluded that about half the subducting carbon is returned to the convecting mantle, we find that relatively little carbon may be recycled. If so, input from subduction zones into the overlying plate is larger than output from arc volcanoes plus diffuse venting, and substantial quantities of carbon are stored in the mantle lithosphere and crust. Also, if the subduction zone carbon cycle is nearly closed on time scales of 5-10 Ma, then the carbon content of the mantle lithosphere + crust + ocean + atmosphere must be increasing. Such an increase is consistent with inferences from noble gas data. Carbon in diamonds, which may have been recycled into the convecting mantle, is a small fraction of the global carbon inventory.},

  abstract = {Deep-Earth volatile cycles couple the mantle with near-surface reservoirs. Volatiles are emitted by volcanism and, in particular, from mid-ocean ridges, which are the most prolific source of basaltic volcanism. Estimates of volatile extraction from the asthenosphere beneath ridges typically rely on measurements of undegassed lavas combined with simple petrogenetic models of the mean degree of melting. Estimated volatile fluxes have large uncertainties; this is partly due to a poor understanding of how volatiles are transported by magma in the asthenosphere. Here, we assess the fate of mantle volatiles through numerical simulations of melting and melt transport at mid-ocean ridges. Our simulations are based on two-phase, magma/mantle dynamics theory coupled to an idealised thermodynamic model of mantle melting in the presence of water and carbon dioxide. We combine simulation results with catalogued observations of all ridge segments to estimate a range of likely volatile output from the global mid-ocean ridge system. We thus predict global MOR crust production of 66--73 Gt/yr (22--24 km3/yr) and global volatile output of 52--110 Mt/yr, corresponding to mantle volatile contents of 100--200 ppm. We find that volatile extraction is limited: up to half of deep, volatile-rich melt is not focused to the axis but is rather deposited along the LAB. As these distal melts crystallise and fractionate, they metasomatise the base of the lithosphere, creating rheological heterogeneity that could contribute to the seismic signature of the LAB.},

  abstract = {Although Australia has been the subject of a wide range of seismological studies, these have concentrated on specific features of the continent at crustal scales and on the broad scale features in the mantle. The Australian Seismological Reference Model (AuSREM) is designed to bring together the existing information, and provide a synthesis in the form of a 3-D model that can provide the basis for future refinement from more detailed studies. Extensive studies in the last few decades provide good coverage for much of the continent, and the crustal model builds on the various data sources to produce a representative model that captures the major features of the continental structure and provides a basis for a broad range of further studies. The model is grid based with a 0.5? sampling in latitude and longitude, and is designed to be fully interpolable, so that properties can be extracted at any point. The crustal structure is built from five-layer representations of refraction and receiver function studies and tomographic information. The AuSREM crustal model is available at 1 km intervals. The crustal component makes use of prior compilations of sediment thicknesses, with cross checks against recent reflection profiling, and provides P and S wavespeed distributions through the crust. The primary information for Pwavespeed comes from refraction profiles, for S wavespeed from receiver function studies.We are also able to use the results of ambient noise tomography to link the point observations into national coverage. Density values are derived using results from gravity interpretations with an empirical relation between P wavespeed and density. AuSREM is able to build on a new map of depth to Moho, which has been created using all available information including Moho picks from over 12 000 km of full crustal profiling across the continent. The crustal component ofAuSREMprovides a representative model that should be useful for modelling of seismic wave propagation and calculation of crustal corrections for tomography. Other applications include gravity studies and dynamic topography at the continental scale. {\copyright} The Authors 2012.

Along an approximately north--south line there is then an eastward step to thinner lithosphere ({$\sim$}150 km thick) but still with fast shear-wave speeds. A further more irregular transition to the east marks the transition to lowered shear-wave speeds. The eastern transition at 75 km depth is in close agreement with the original Tasman Line, whereas the two more westerly transitions do not bear a simple relation to the more recent group of Tasman Lines defined from crustal information (outcrop and inferred geophysical trends). The west- ward transition to the thickest coherent lithosphere (near 140 E) may well mark the edge of the ancient core of the continent, but the current mantle structures must bear the scars of the breakups and reas- sembly that have created the current Australian continent.},

  abstract = {The dynamic processes within the Earth leave their record in geophysical and geochemical variation about the general stratification with depth. A snapshot of current structure is provided by geophysical evidence, whereas geochemical information provides a perspective over the age of the Earth. The combination of information on the distribution of heterogeneity from geophysical and geochemical sources provides enhanced insight into likely geodynamic processes. A variety of techniques can be used to examine crustal structure, but the major source of information on seismic heterogeneity within the Earth comes from tomographic studies, exploiting surface waves for the lithosphere and body waves for the bulk Earth. A powerful tool for examining the character of mantle heterogeneity is the comparison of images of bulk-sound and shear-wave speed extracted in a single inversion, since this isolates the dependencies on the elastic moduli. Such studies are particularly effective when a common path coverage is achieved for P and S as, for example, when common source and receiver pairs are extracted for arrival times of the phases. The relative behaviour of the bulk-sound and shear-wave speeds allows the definition of heterogeneity regimes. For subduction zones, a large part of the imaged structure comes from S-wave speed variations. The narrow segments of fast wave speeds in the lower mantle, in the depth range 900 - 1500 km, are dominated by S variations, with very little bulk-sound contribution, so images of P-wave speed are controlled by shear-wave variability. Deep in the mantle, there are many features with high seismic-wave speed without an obvious association with subduction in the last 100 million years, which suggests long-lived preservation of components of the geodynamic cycle. The base of the Earth's mantle is a complex zone with widespread indications of heterogeneity on many scales, discontinuities of variable character, and shear-wave anisotropy. Discordance between P- and S-wave speed anomalies suggests the presence of chemical heterogeneity rather than just the effect of temperature.},

Global seismic tomography indicates a strong zone of reduced seismic wavespeed near the core-mantle boundary beneath the Coral Sea, between Australia and New Guinea, yet unlike the majority of such features, there is no obvious volcanic `hotspot' at Earth's surface. By analysing a combined global and regional tomography model, we suggest here that since 20 Ma, remnants of past subduction, imaged as fast wavespeed zones in seismic tomography, have impeded any direct upwelling from depth. The spatio-temporal patterns and geochemical signature of volcanism in this region, however, suggests that some plume material has made its way through this maze of slab remnants, to impinge on the strong lithospheric step associated with the edge of the thick North Australian craton, which extends into New Guinea. We suggest that following the arrival of the extended Australian continent into the zone of influence of this cryptic mantle plume at {$\sim$}10 Ma, the combination of largely blocked upward flow and shallow edge- and shear-driven processes modulates the regional flow regime to spawn volcanism at the observed locations in NE Australia and New Guinea.}

The autocorrelograms emphasise near vertically travelling waves, so that multiples are more muted than in receiver function studies and it is possible to work at higher frequencies than for receiver functions. Across a wide range of geological environments in Australia, in the 0.5--4.0 Hz frequency band, distinct reflections are seen in the crust underlain by weaker reflectivity in the lithosphere and asthenosphere. The base of crustal reflectivity fits well with Moho estimates from other classes of information. Few mantle reflectors have been seen in conventional reflection profiling at frequencies above 10 Hz; the presence of reflections in the 0.5--4.0 Hz band suggests variations on vertical scales of a few hundred metres with amplitudes of the order of 1\%. There are slight indications of a change of reflection character in the lower part of the lithosphere in the transition to the asthenosphere. At a few stations there is a very clear lamination at asthenospheric depth, as well as reflections from the base of the S wave low velocity zone. Reflection bands often occur at depths where discontinuities have been inferred from S wave receiver function work at the same station, but would not by themselves be distinctive of a mid-lithosphere discontinuity.},

Recent extensive seismic reflection profiling provides a comprehensive data set to investigate the nature of the Moho in a wide range of geological environments. In reflection seismology the crust is normally characterized by distinct reflectivity whose base is taken as the location of the reflection Moho. This attribution to the base of the crust ties well to refraction and receiver function studies that make a more direct estimate of the depth to the base of the crust. The character of the reflection Moho varies widely across the Precambrian areas of Australia with no consistent link to the surface geology or the estimated age of the crust. In a number of places a double Moho is preserved with underthrusting, suggesting that the reflection Moho is a very ancient feature (at least 1400Ma in the Capricorn Orogen). Elsewhere, the current Moho reflects multiple generations of crustal reworking.},

Differential attenuation measurements are made for seismic waves refracted through the mantle beneath the Australasian region and are then used to construct 3D images of the attenuation of shear and compressional waves. The differential attenuation between different seismic phases is estimated using a spectral ratio method in the frequency band 0.25-1.0 Hz using a multi-taper method. Over this band the attenuation is nearly independent of frequency so that the logarithmic spectral ratio is a linear function of frequency. Differential measurements are made either between P and S phases on the same record or between stations for P and S waves separately. Images of seismic attenuation for the Australasian region are produced using a tomographic inversion, with the fast marching method employed to trace ray paths in an initial 3-D model derived from surface wave tomography. There is a deep seated horizontal contrast between central Australia and the eastern seaboard. The crustal and lithospheric mantle beneath the Archean and Proterozoic rocks in the west and in the middle of the continent have low seismic attenuation, whereas the Phanerozoic material in the east is more attenuative. Regions with recent volcanism, most likely associated with hot spots such as near Bass Strait and the Coral Sea, display high seismic attenuation anomalies. There is a strong contrast in attenuation between the relatively low loss lithosphere and the high loss asthenosphere beneath with a change by a factor of 6-10. Anisotropy in attenuation is slight even though some would be expected from the radial anisotropy seen in shear wavespeed in the lithosphere. {\copyright} 2011 Geological Society of Australia.},

Published compilations indicate it occurred in two main phases, one centered in the Late Carboniferous ({$\sim$}315 Ma) and the other in the Early Permian ({$\sim$}295 Ma), before waning over the rest of the Early Permian and into the Middle Permian ({$\sim$}290 Ma to 275 Ma), and culminating with the final demise of Alpine-style ice sheets in eastern Australia in the Late Permian ({$\sim$}260 to 255 Ma). Recent global climate modeling has drawn attention to silicate weathering CO2 consumption of an initially high Greater Variscan edifice residing within a static Pangea A configuration as the leading cause of reduction of atmospheric CO2 concentrations below glaciation thresholds. Here we show that the best available and least-biased paleomagnetic reference poles place the collision between Laurasia and Gondwana that produced the Greater Variscan orogen in a more dynamic position within a Pangea B configuration that had about 30\% more continental area in the prime equatorial humid belt for weathering and which drifted northward into the tropical arid belt as it transformed to Pangea A by the Late Permian. The presence of widespread equatorial coal basins with Euramerica flora in the footprint of the Greater Variscan orogen during the Late Carboniferous is more compatible with a heterogeneous horst-and-graben morphology, characterized by uplifted crystalline massifs acting as loci of intense silicate weathering CO2 consumption and supplying sediment for proximal basins as venues of organic carbon burial, than a contiguous high mountain plateau, as assumed in recent climate modeling of the LPIA and its demise. The culminating phase of the LPIA occurred at about 275 Ma with the transformation from Pangea B to Pangea A and the attendant reduction of continental area in the equatorial humid belt, as well as with continued northward drift that placed what remained of the Greater Variscan orogen into the Zechstein arid belt in the Late Permian, by which time the geologic landscape was largely blanketed with siliciclastics. The resulting warming from reduced silicate weathering and thus increasing pCO2 was interrupted at 260 Ma with a cooling trend that coincided with emplacement of the Emeishan large igneous province on the equatorial South China Craton as well as the drift of the Cimmerian continental blocks through the equatorial humid belt due to opening of the Neo-Tethys. A return to ice age conditions from the increase in silicate weathering uptake of CO2 was avoided by drift of the Emeishan large igneous province out of the equatorial belt, that in conjunction with massive outgassing from emplacement of the Siberian Traps in high latitudes at the end of the Permian (252 Ma), helped steer the climate system to sustained non-glacial conditions.},

The core samples were recovered at depths of about 4670 to 11,720m, and the outcrop samples represent lithologies similar to those of the core samples. Measurements were carried out on sample cubes of dry rocks (43mm edge length) in a multianvil apparatus, allowing simultaneous measurements of VP and VS in the three structural directions X, Y, Z of the sample cubes and direct determination of length changes (volume change) of the sample with increasing pressure and temperature. Pronounced pressure (crack) sensitivity of P- and S-wave velocities indicates strong decompaction in the cores, due to drilling-induced damage and rapid pressure and temperature release during core retrieval. Marked velocity anisotropy and shear wave splitting is present in the foliated Proterozoic and Archean gneisses and amphibolites, due to oriented microcracks and lattice (crystallographic) preferred orientation (LPO) of the constituent mica and hornblende minerals. The experimentally determined intrinsic velocities and anisotropies compare fairly well with corresponding calculated data, based on the LPO and the single crystal properties of the major minerals. Measurements and calculations confirm strong relations of velocity anisotropy, shear wave splitting and shear wave polarisation to the structural frame of the rocks (foliation, lineation). The experimentally derived in situ velocities representing the averages of the velocities measured in the three structural directions (three P-wave and six S-wave velocities) compare fairly well with VSP data. The fit is even better when anisotropy (related to foliation and foliation dip) is included in the determination of the in situ velocities. From the relationship between experimental and calculated shear wave splitting data and the structural frame (foliation and lineation) of the Proterozoic and Archean rocks we interpret the VSP-derived shear wave polarisation at Kola (Digranes et al., 1996) as resulting from the strong alignment of mica and hornblende, defining the foliation.}

A scaling analysis is first used to obtain a theoretical expression for the melting rate that is valid for a certain range of Stefan numbers. This expression is then compared with melting velocities measured in laboratory experiments in which ice and wax are melted when they are overlain or underlain by hot aqueous solutions. The melting velocities are consistent with the theoretical expression, and are found to depend on the heats of solution that are released when the melted solids mix with the solutions. The experiments also indicate that, for vigorous convection to occur during the melting of a floor, the unstable compositional buoyancy needs to be at least twice the stabilizing thermal buoyancy.             An important geological situation in which melting occurs is when large volumes of basaltic magma are intruded into the Earth's continental crust.

The temperature-dependent properties of thermal conductivity, specific heat and the coefficient of thermal expansion are considered, as well as conductivity contrasts between the crust and mantle and lithosphere-scale radiogenic heat production. The effects of conductivity and radioactivity are complementary, and can be predicted from the way in which they influence the initial and final steady-state geothermal gradient. A convex-up initial gradient, such as is generated by the conductivity and radioactivity functions and is also assumed to be the case based on independent evidence, will lead to more initial subsidence than in a simple constant-parameter model. The final subsidence will also be greater in the modified model, due to the fact that the stretching event will result in a lithospheric column which is intrinsically cooler than in the pre-deformation case. Because the coefficient of thermal expansion rises with increasing temperature, including its temperature dependence will result in a model with substantially less initial subsidence than one with a constant value. When these parameters are combined into a single model, the initial subsidence is approximately 15-20\% less than in the constant-parameter model if radioactivity is not included, and 10\% less if it is, while the final subsidence is about 5\% greater without radioactivity and 7-9\% greater with radioactivity included. Depending on the magnitude of extension, these effects can translate into differences of tens to hundreds of meters when compared to the constant-parameter model.},

  abstract = {Determining Earth's structure is a fundamental goal of Earth science, and geophysical methods play a prominent role in investigating Earth's interior. Geochemical, cosmochemical, and petrological analyses of terrestrial samples and meteoritic material provide equally important insights. Complementary information comes from high-pressure mineral physics and chemistry, i.e., use of sophisticated experimental techniques and numerical methods that are capable of attaining or simulating physical properties at very high pressures and temperatures, thereby allowing recovered samples from Earth's crust and mantle to be analyzed in the laboratory or simulated computationally at the conditions that prevail in Earth's mantle and core. This is particularly important given that the vast bulk of Earth's interior is geochemically unsampled. This paper describes a quantitative approach that combines data and results from mineral physics, petrological analyses of mantle minerals, and geophysical inverse calculations, in order to map geophysical data directly for mantle composition (major element chemistry and water content) and thermal state. We illustrate the methodology by inverting a set of long-period electromagnetic response functions beneath six geomagnetic stations that cover a range of geological settings for major element chemistry, water content, and thermal state of the mantle. The results indicate that interior structure and constitution of the mantle can be well-retrieved given a specific set of measurements describing (1) the conductivity of mantle minerals, (2) the partitioning behavior of water between major upper mantle and transition-zone minerals, and (3) the ability of nominally anhydrous minerals to store water in their crystal structures. Specifically, upper mantle water contents determined here bracket the ranges obtained from analyses of natural samples, whereas transition-zone water concentration is an order-of-magnitude greater than that of the upper mantle and appears to vary laterally underneath the investigated locations.},

Regional bathymetric deviations from the cooling plate age-depth curve, called residual depth anomalies, can therefore be used as indicators of dynamic topography in oceans. In this work, we first evaluated the oceanic residual depth anomalies. We then compute the dynamic topography for the flow induced by density perturbations converted from seismic tomography models by assuming deltarho is-proportional-to deltav. We found that the predicted dynamic topography correlates with the depth anomalies when the density perturbations in the shallow part of the upper mantle were inferred from slab densities, not from tomographic models. We estimated a new age-depth curve based on depths corrected for dynamic topography. This corrected age-depth curve shows that the corrected depths for old seafloor (70 approximately 110 Ma) are a few hundred meters deeper than those uncorrected.}

  abstract = {Recent revisions to the satellite-derived vertical gravity gradient (VGG) data reveal more detail of the ocean bottom and have allowed us to develop a non-linear inversion method to detect seamounts in VGG data. We approximate VGG anomalies over seamounts as sums of individual, partially overlapping, elliptical polynomial functions, which allows us to form a non-linear inverse problem by fitting the polynomial model to the observations. Model parameters for a potential seamount include geographical location, peak VGG amplitude, major and minor axes of the elliptical base, and the azimuth of the major axis. The non-linear inversion is very sensitive to the initial values for the location and amplitude; hence, they are constrained by the centre and amplitude of the uppermost contours obtained with a 1-E{\"o}tv{\"o}s contour interval. With these initial conditions from contouring, we execute a step-wise and fully automated inversion and obtain optimal model estimates for potential seamounts; these are statistically evaluated for significance using the Akaike Information Criterion andFtests. A logarithmic barrier technique is applied to ensure positivity of all seamount amplitudes. After automatic and manual inspections of the model parameters we estimate actual heights and basal ellipses of the inspected potential seamounts directly from the predicted bathymetry grid. In this study, we find globally 24643 potential seamounts (h{$\geq$} 0.1 km) that are located away from continental margins; 8458 potential seamounts are taller than 1 km. Although our global estimate is significantly lower than predictions from previous studies, a first-order reconciliation of the size-frequency statistics obtained from those studies reveals that the previous counts are systematically overestimated. Because of the ambiguity of gravity signals due to small seamounts ofh{\textbackslash}textless 1 km and the overlap with abyssal hills, we estimate the global seamount census to lie in the 40000-55000 range. The seamount data from this study are accessible from. {\copyright} 2011 The Authors Geophysical Journal International {\copyright} 2011 RAS.},

  abstract = {All large continental igneous provinces and most high-temperature magmas (picrites, komatiites) are found on the margins of cratonic lithosphere. The standard plume model of flood basalt formation offers no explanation for this observation. We propose that thick lithosphere (usually Archean) adjacent to thinner lithosphere may control the locations of flood basalt provinces. The boundary between thick and thin lithosphere focuses both the strain in the lithosphere and the upwelling convection. In addition, the non-uniform boundary condition actually induces a small-scale form of convection that is not present in simple convection and plume models. Whereas plumes are a form of convective instability rising from the base of a convecting system heated from below, the form of convection we are discussing is triggered from above. Unlike other lithospheric mechanisms, the asymmetric lithosphere does not require convective thinning or heating of the plate in order to produce melting. This eliminates time delay between the arrival of the plume head and the onset of volcanism in the stretching model. We consider a series of calculations with a step-function change in thickness of the boundary layer and an externally imposed pull-apart. The flow in our models is shallow and sub-horizontal, and brings hot material from under the thicker (cratonic) boundary layer towards the pull-apart. A simple estimate of the amount of melt generated by this mechanism suggests that it is capable of producing a large igneous province, even for a dry mantle.},

While it may be straight-forward to assert that chemical buoyancy and high viscosity are needed to stabilize cratons, there are many questions regarding craton formation, variability (both in space and time), and evolution that remain unanswered. In numerical studies, strong and buoyant cratonic keels survive relatively undeformed for several mantle overturn times (the equivalent of several hundred million years); extending this to several billion years remains a challenge. The strength required to stabilize keels in some of these numerical experiments exceeds reasonable estimates of the laboratory measurements of strength of mantle materials (including both the effects of temperature and melt-depletion). In addition, the most common explanation of keel formation, vertical stacking of subducted plate, requires the keel material to be deformable at the time of formation and soon afterward the keel material becomes strong enough to resist shearing. The extent to which cratonic keels interact with and influence the pattern of mantle convection, by nucleating small-scale edge-driven convection or by coupling plate motions to deeper mantle flow, remains an open question.},

We consider the effect of aspect ratio and far-field boundary conditions on the small-scale flow driven by a discontinuity in the thickness of the lithosphere. In an isothermal mantle, with no other outside influences, the basic small-scale flow aligns with the lithosphere such that there is a downwelling at the lithospheric discontinuity (edge-driven flow); however, the pattern of the small-scale flow is strongly dependent on the large-scale thermal structure of a much broader area of the upper mantle. Long-wavelength temperature anomalies in the upper mantle can overwhelm edge-driven flow on a short timescale; however, convective motions work to homogenize these anomalies on the order of 100 million years while cratonic roots can remain stable for longer time periods. A systematic study of the effect of the boundary conditions and aspect ratio of the domain shows that small-scale, and large-scale flows are driven by the lithosphere. Edge-driven flow produces velocities on the order of 20 mm/yr. This is comparable to calculations by others and we can expect an increase in this rate as the mantle viscosity is decreased.},

The north Atlantic ocean basin is anomalously shallow--by as much as 1500 m--compared to similarly aged ocean floors on the rest of the of the world's ocean basins. I use a series of calculations to investigate whether the geoid and topographic anomalies in the north Atlantic are consistent with the edge-driven convection hypothesis, with small-scale flow driven by the Greenland and Scandinavian cratons. I find that the small-scale convection pattern driven by the edge of a deep cratonic root can extend from the craton as far as 1000 km and upwell along a passive spreading ridge. However, the north Atlantic geoid and topographic anomalies are difficult to reconcile with either a plume or an edge-driven convection mechanism.},

A Pliocene age (3.0Ma) documents a younger phase of volcanism at one MBS and a Pleistocene age (1.8Ma) for the submarine base of Peter I Island. Together with published data, the new age data imply that Cenozoic intraplate magmatism occurred at distinct time intervals in spatially confined areas of the Amundsen Sea, excluding an origin through a fixed mantle plume. Peter I Island appears strongly influenced by an EMII type mantle component that may reflect shallow mantle recycling of a continental raft during the final breakup of Gondwana. By contrast the Sr-Nd-Pb-Hf isotopic compositions of the MBS display a strong affinity to a HIMU-type mantle source. On a regional scale the isotopic signatures overlap with those from volcanics related to the West Antarctic Rift System, and Cretaceous intraplate volcanics in and off New Zealand. We propose reactivation of the HIMU material, initially accreted to the base of continental lithosphere during the pre-rifting stage of Marie Byrd Land/Zealandia to explain intraplate volcanism in the Amundsen Sea in the absence of a long-lived hotspot. We propose continental insulation flow as the most plausible mechanism to transfer the sub-continental accreted plume material into the shallow oceanic mantle. Crustal extension at the southern boundary of the Bellingshausen Plate from about 74 to 62Ma may have triggered adiabatic rise of the HIMU material from the base of Marie Byrd Land to form the MBS. The De Gerlache Seamounts are most likely related to a preserved zone of lithospheric weakness underneath the De Gerlache Gravity Anomaly. {\copyright} 2013 International Association for Gondwana Research.},

  abstract = {Isostatic gravity anomalies provide a measure of the Earth's gravity field free from the gravitational attractions of the topography and its isostatic compensation, most commonly represented by a variation in the depth of a compensating density contrast, for example the Moho. They are used by both geodesists and geophysicists alike, though often for different purposes. Unfortunately though, the effect of subsurface loading on the lithosphere renders transfer function (admittance) methods unusable when surface and subsurface loads coexist. Where they exist, subsurface loads are often expressed in the Bouguer anomaly but not in the topography, and it is shown here that this phase disconnect cannot be faithfully represented by either realor complex-valued analytic admittance functions. Additionally, many studies that employ the isostatic anomaly ignore the effects of the flexural rigidity of the lithosphere, most often represented as an effective elastic thickness (Te), and assume only Airy isostasy, i.e. surface loading of a plate with zero elastic thickness. The consequences of such an omission are studied here, finding that failure to account for flexural rigidity and subsurface loading can result in (1) over- or underestimates of both inverted Moho depths and dynamic topography amplitude, and (2) underestimates of the size of topographic load that can be supported by the plate without flexure. An example of the latter is shown over Europe. Finally, it is demonstrated how low values of the isostatic anomaly variance can actually be biased by these anomalies having low power at the long wavelengths while still possessing high power at middle to short wavelengths, compared to the corresponding Bouguer anomaly power spectrum. This will influence the choice of best-fitting isostatic model if the model is chosen by minimization of the isostatic anomaly standard deviation.},

  abstract = {Abstract Western North America has an average elevation that is {$\sim$}2 km higher than cratonic North America. This difference coincides with a westward decrease in average lithospheric thickness from {$\sim$}240 to {\textbackslash}textless100 km. Tomographic models show that slow shear wave velocity anomalies lie beneath this region, coinciding with the pattern of basaltic magmatism. To investigate relationships between magmatism, shear wave velocity, and temperature, we analyzed a suite of {\textbackslash}textgreater260 basaltic samples. Forward and inverse modeling of carefully selected major, trace, and rare earth elements were used to determine melt fraction as a function of depth. Basaltic melt appears to have been generated by adiabatic decompression of dry peridotite with asthenospheric potential temperatures of 1340 {\textpm} 20 {$^\circ$}C. Potential temperatures as high as 1365 {$^\circ$}C were obtained for the Snake River Plain. For the youngest (i.e., {\textbackslash}textless5 Ma) basalts with a subplate geochemical signature, there is a positive correlation between shear wave velocities and trace element ratios such as La/Yb. The significance of this correlation is explored by converting shear wave velocity into temperature using a global empirical parameterization. Calculated temperatures agree with those determined by inverse modeling of rare earth elements. We propose that regional epeirogenic uplift of western North America is principally maintained by widespread asthenospheric temperature anomalies lying beneath a lithospheric plate, which is considerably thinner than it was in Late Cretaceous times. Our proposal accounts for the distribution and composition of basaltic magmatism and is consistent with regional heat flow anomalies.}

  abstract = {A planet's crust bears witness to the history of planetary formation and evolution, but for Mars, no absolute measurement of crustal thickness has been available. Here, we determine the structure of the crust beneath the InSight landing site on Mars using both marsquake recordings and the ambient wavefield. By analyzing seismic phases that are reflected and converted at subsurface interfaces, we find that the observations are consistent with models with at least two and possibly three interfaces. If the second interface is the boundary of the crust, the thickness is 20 {\textpm} 5 kilometers, whereas if the third interface is the boundary, the thickness is 39 {\textpm} 8 kilometers. Global maps of gravity and topography allow extrapolation of this point measurement to the whole planet, showing that the average thickness of the martian crust lies between 24 and 72 kilometers. Independent bulk composition and geodynamic constraints show that the thicker model is consistent with the abundances of crustal heat-producing elements observed for the shallow surface, whereas the thinner model requires greater concentration at depth.},

We discuss the range of nutrient and metal concentrations observed in groundwater and their relationship to land use, and explore the chemical changes that nutrients and metals undergo during their seaward journey through the aquifer. Climate change is likely to affect both the quantity and the quality of SGD, and we investigate these effects, which are only beginning to be studied. The chapter concludes with a discussion of active areas of SGD research, including expanding the geographic scope of SGD studies; characterizing and reducing the uncertainty associated with SGD measurements; understanding the behavior of nutrients, metals, and other pollutants in the subterranean estuary; and modeling SGD on a global scale.},

  abstract = {The subduction of oceanic plateaux, which contain extraordinarily thick basaltic crust and are the marine counterparts of continental flood-basalt provinces, is an important factor in many current models of plate motion and provides a potential mechanism for triggering plate reorganization. To evaluate such models, it is essential to decipher the history of the collision between the largest and thickest of the world's oceanic plateaux, the Ontong Java plateau, and the Australian plate, but this has been hindered by poor constraints for the arrival of the plateau at the Melanesian trench. Here we present (40)Ar-(39)Ar geochronological data on hotspot volcanoes in eastern Australian that reveal a strong link between collision of the Greenland-sized Ontong Java plateau with the Melanesian arc and motion of the Australian plate. The new ages define a short-lived period of reduced northward plate motion between 26 and 23 Myr ago, coincident with an eastward offset in the contemporaneous tracks of seamount chains in the Tasman Sea east of Australia. These features record a brief westward deflection of the Australian plate as the plateau entered and choked the Melanesian trench 26 Myr ago. From 23 Myr ago, Australia returned to a rapid northerly trajectory at roughly the same time that southwest-directed subduction began along the Trobriand trough. The timing and brevity of this collisional event correlate well with offsets in hotspot seamount tracks on the Pacific plate, including the archetypal Hawaiian chain, and thus provide strong evidence that immense oceanic plateaux, like the Ontong Java, can contribute to initiating rapid change in plate boundaries and motions on a global scale.},

  abstract = {Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov (JFNK) methods are synergistic combinations of Newton-type methods for superlinearly convergent solution of nonlinear equations and Krylov subspace methods for solving the Newton correction equations. The link between the two methods is the Jacobian-vector product, which may be probed approximately without forming and storing the elements of the true Jacobian, through a variety of means, Various approximations to the Jacobian matrix may still be required for preconditioning the resulting Krylov iteration. As with Krylov methods for linear problems, successful application of the JFNK method to any given problem is dependent on adequate preconditioning. JFNK has potential for application throughout problems governed by nonlinear partial differential equations and integro-differential equations. In this survey paper, we place JFNK in context with other nonlinear solution algorithms for both boundary value problems (BVPs) and initial value problems (IVPs). We provide an overview of the mechanics of JFNK and attempt to illustrate the wide variety of preconditioning options available. It is emphasized that JFNK can be wrapped (as an accelerator) around another nonlinear fixed point method (interpreted as a preconditioning process, potentially with significant code reuse). The aim of this paper is not to trace fully the evolution of JFNK, nor to provide proofs of accuracy or optimal convergence for all of the constituent methods, but rather to present the reader with a perspective on how JFNK may be applicable to applications of interest and to provide sources of further practical information. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Royal Astronomical Society.We present the new model SP12RTS of isotropic shear-wave (VS) and compressional-wave (VP) velocity variations in the Earth's mantle. SP12RTS is derived using the same methods as employed in the construction of the shear-wave velocity models S20RTS and S40RTS, and the same data types. SP12RTS includes additional traveltime measurements of P-waves and new splitting measurements: 33 normal modes with sensitivity to the compressional-wave velocity and 9 Stoneley modes with sensitivity primarily to the lowermost mantle. Contrary to S20RTS and S40RTS, variations in VS and VP are determined without invoking scaling relationships. Lateral velocity variations in SP12RTS are parametrised using spherical harmonics up to degree 12, to focus on long-wavelength features of VS and VP and their ratio R. Large-lowvelocity provinces (LLVPs) are observed for both VS and VP. SP12RTS also features an increase of R up to 2500 km depth, followed by a decrease towards the core-mantle boundary. A negative correlation between the shear-wave and bulk-sound velocity variations is observed for both the LLVPs and the surrounding mantle. These characteristics can be explained by the presence of post-perovskite or large-scale chemical heterogeneity in the lower mantle.},

Examination was performed on vitrinite, liptinite and inertinite concentrates prepared from channel samples of steam coal (R (sub r) =0.70\%) and coking coal (R (sub r) =1.25\%), collected from seam 405 of the Upper Silesian Coal Basin. The concentrates were heated at temperatures of 400-1200 degrees C for 1 h time in an argon atmosphere. All components examined in this study: vitrinite, sporinite and semifusinite as well as matrix of vitrinite and liptinite cokes, despite of rank of their parent coal, show, in general, the most important changes of reflectance value and optical anisotropy when heated at 500 degrees C, 800 degrees C (with the exception of bireflectance value of sporinite) and 1200 degrees C. After heating the steam coal at 1200 degrees C, the vitrinite and the semifusinite reveal similar reflectances, whereas the latter a slightly stronger anisotropy. Sporinite and matrix of liptinite coke have lower reflectances but anisotropy (R (sub bi) and R (sub am) values) similar to those observed for vitrinite and semifusinite. However, at 1000 degrees C sporinite and matrix of liptinite coke have the highest reflectivity of the studied components. The RIS at 1200 degrees C is the same for all components. The optical properties of the three macerals in the coking coal become similar after heating at 1000 degrees C. Coke obtained at 1200 degrees C did not contain distinguishable vitrinite grains. At 1200 degrees C semifusinite and vitrinite coke matrix have highest R (sub r) values among the examined components. Maximum reflectance (R (sub max) ) reach similar values for vitrinite and sporinite, slightly lower for semifusinite. Matrix of liptinite coke and matrix of vitrinite coke have considerably stronger anisotropy (R (sub bi) and R (sub am) values) than other components.

The samples of vitrinite concentrate (Vt content 90\%, R (sub r) = 1.17\%) were inserted in the furnace at room temperature and subjected to a heating rate of 60 degrees C/min. To assess the effects of the experiment, random reflectance as well as apparent maximum and minimum reflectances of vitrinite were measured on the raw and thermally treated concentrates. Employing the method and computer programme of W. E. Kilby, the true maximum, intermediate and minimum reflectances of vitrinite as well as reflectance anisotropy and Reflectance-Indicating Surface (RIS) shapes were evaluated. Transformation of vitrinite subjected to heating is influenced more by the increase of temperature than the time applied. During the plastic stage (400-500 degrees C), vitrinite is subjected to substantial chemical and physical alteration. It is manifested by chemical decomposition, significant mass loss and mesophase appearance. Porosity, relief, reflectance and bireflectance of the vitrinite grains increase with heating. At the temperature of 1200 degrees C, random vitrinite reflectance reaches 6.62\% with bireflectance of 3.46\%. Mesophase at 1200 degrees C was characterised by mean reflectance equal to 9.25\% and a bireflectance of 13.35\%. The reflectance character of vitrinite changes from biaxial negative into biaxial positive-negative. However, the original RIS shape, resulting from the tectonic regime during the main phase of coalification, is not fully transformed until heated to 1200 degrees C. Reflectance character of mesophase is consistently biaxial negative. The internal structure of mesophase is thought to be better organised than the internal structure of vitrinite.},

The tectonically forced SPM accommodates the large-scale behavior envisaged in classical and contemporary conceptual geomorphic models and provides a framework for their integration and unification.

The concepts of dynamic equilibrium and grade are quantified at the microscale for segments of uniform gradient subject to tectonic uplift. At the larger meso- and macroscales (which represent individual interfluves and landscapes including a number of drainage basins, respectively) the system response to tectonic forcing is linear for uplift geometries that are symmetric with respect to baselevel and which impose a fully integrated drainage to baselevel. For these linear models the response time and the transfer function as a function of scale characterize the model behavior. Numerical experiments show that the styles of landscape evolution depend critically on the timescales of the tectonic processes in relation to the response time of the landscape. When tectonic timescales are much longer than the landscape response time, the resulting dynamic equilibrium landscapes correspond to those envisaged by Hack (1960). When tectonic timescales are of the same order as the landscape response time and when tectonic variations take the form of pulses (much shorter than the response time), evolving landscapes conform to the Penck type (1972) and to the Davis (1889, 1899) and King (1953, 1962) type frameworks, respectively. The behavior of the SPM highlights the importance of phase shifts or delays of the landform response and sediment yield in relation to the tectonic forcing. Finally, nonlinear behavior resulting from more general uplift geometries is discussed. A number of model experiments illustrate the importance of ``fundamental form,'' which is an expression of the conformity of antecedent topography with the current tectonic regime. Lack of conformity leads to models that exhibit internal thresholds and a complex response},

  abstract = {What are the conditions under which lithospheric extension drives exhumation of the deep orogenic crust during the formation of gneiss domes? The mechanical link between extension of shallow crust and flow of deep crust is investigated using two-dimensional numerical experiments of lithospheric extension in which the crust is 60km thick and the deep-crust viscosity and density parameter space is explored. Results indicate that the style of extension of the shallow crust and the path, magnitude, and rate of flow of deep crust are dynamically linked through the deep-crust viscosity, with density playing an important role in experiments with a high-viscosity deep crust. Three main groups of domes are defined based on their mechanisms of exhumation across the viscosity-density parameter space. In the first group (low-viscosity, low-density deep crust), domes develop by lateral and upward flow of the deep crust at kmm.y-1 velocity rates (i.e. rate of experiment boundary extension). In this case, extension in the shallow crust is localized on a single interface, and the deep crust traverses the entire thickness of the crust to the Earth's near-surface in 5m.y. This high exhuming power relies on the dynamic feedback between the flow of deep crust and the localization of extension in the shallow crust. The second group (intermediate-viscosity, low-density deep crust) has less exhuming power because the stronger deep crust flows less readily and instead accommodates more uniform extension, which imparts distributed extension to the shallow crust. The third group represents the upper limits of viscosity and density for the deep crust; in this case the low buoyancy of the deep crust results in localized thinning of the crust with large upward motion of the Moho and lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary. These numerical experiments test the exhuming power of the deep crust in the formation of extensional gneiss domes.},

  abstract = {For over 35 years, deep seismic reflection profiles have been acquired routinely across Australia to better understand the crustal architecture and geodynamic evolution of key geological provinces and basins. Major crustal-scale breaks have been interpreted in some of the profiles, and are often inferred to be relict sutures between different crustal blocks, as well as sometimes being important conduits for mineralising fluids to reach the upper crust. The widespread coverage of the seismic profiles now allows the construction of a new map of major crustal boundaries across Australia, which will better define the architecture of the crustal blocks in three dimensions. It also enables a better understanding of how the Australian continent was constructed from the Mesoarchean through to the Phanerozoic, and how this evolution and these boundaries have controlled metallogenesis. Starting with the locations in 3D of the crustal breaks identified in the seismic profiles, geological (e.g. outcrop mapping, drill hole, geochronology, isotope) and geophysical (e.g. gravity, aeromagnetic, magnetotelluric) data are used to map the crustal boundaries, in plan view, away from the seismic profiles. Some of the boundaries mapped are subsurface boundaries, and, in many cases, occur several kilometres below the surface; hence they will not match directly with structures mapped at the surface. For some of these boundaries, a high level of confidence can be placed on the location, whereas the location of other boundaries can only be considered to have medium or low confidence. In other areas, especially in regions covered by thick sedimentary successions, the locations of some crustal boundaries are essentially unconstrained, unless they have been imaged by a seismic profile. From the Mesoarchean to the Phanerozoic, the continent formed by the amalgamation of many smaller crustal blocks over a period of nearly 3 billion years. The identification of crustal boundaries in Australia, and the construction of an Australia-wide GIS dataset and map, will help to constrain tectonic models and plate reconstructions for the geological evolution of Australia, and will provide constraints on the three dimensional architecture of Australia. Deep crustal-penetrating structures, particularly major crustal boundaries, are important conduits to transport mineralising fluids from the mantle and lower crust into the upper crust. There are several greenfields regions across Australia where deep crustal-penetrating structures have been imaged in seismic sections, and have potential as possible areas for future mineral systems exploration.},

The algorithm uses the traveltimes from events located in the study area recorded by all available worldwide stations, as well as times from teleseismic events recorded by European stations. The events from the ISC catalogue have been relocated and combined into composite events. All the traveltimes were corrected for crustal structure using the reference model EuCRUST-07. The resulting velocity anomalies show similar large-scale patterns as observed in previous studies, but have a higher resolution, which allows detection of some features in more detail. For example, it is now possible to assess the depth extension of the small slow velocity body beneath the Eifel region and Eger graben. The P and the S model show a good consistency in the uppermost 200 km below most of the European area and in some parts even in the deeper layers (e.g. beneath the Apennines and the Hellenic arc). The new model provides clear images of some principal features, which were previously detected in a limited number of studies, while the comparison between P- and S-velocity anomalies provides novel constraints to address on their nature (e.g. the gap in the Adriatic plate subducted below the central-southern Apennines). In this paper, we pay special attention to testing the reliability of the results. The random noise effect is evaluated using a test with independent inversion of two data subsets (with odd/even events). The spatial resolution is estimated using different checkerboard tests. Furthermore, we present a synthetic model with realistic patterns, which reproduces after performing forward and inverse modelling the same shape and amplitudes of the anomalies as in the case of the real data inversion. In this case, the parameters of the model can be used to assess the amplitudes of P and S anomalies that is critical for evaluation of other petrophysical parameters (temperature, density, composition, etc.) in the upper mantle. {\^A}{\copyright} 2009 The Authors Journal compilation {\^A}{\copyright} 2009 RAS.},

This Global Strain Rate Model (GSRM v.2.1) is a vast improvement over its predecessor both in terms of amount of data input as in an increase in spatial model resolution by factor of \$2.5 in areas with dense data coverage. We determined 6739 velocities from time series of (mostly) continuous GPS measurements; i.e., by far the largest global velocity solution to date. We transformed 15,772 velocities from 233 (mostly) published studies onto our core solution to obtain 22,511 velocities in the same reference frame. Care is taken to not use velocities from stations (or time periods) that are affected by transient phenomena; i.e., this data set consists of velocities best representing the interseismic plate velocity. About 14\% of the Earth is allowed to deform in 145,086 deforming grid cells (0.25  longitude by 0.2  latitude in dimension). The remainder of the Earth's surface is modeled as rigid spherical caps representing 50 tectonic plates. For 36 plates we present new GPS-derived angular velocities. For all the plates that can be compared with the most recent geologic plate motion model, we find that the difference in angular velocity is significant. The rigid-body rotations are used as boundary conditions in the strain rate calculations. The strain rate field is modeled using the Haines and Holt method, which uses splines to obtain an self-consistent interpolated velocity gradient tensor field, from which strain rates, vorticity rates, and expected velocities are derived. We also present expected faulting orientations in areas with significant vorticity, and update the no-net rotation reference frame associated with our global velocity gradient field. Finally, we present a global map of recurrence times for Mw57.5 characteristic earthquakes.},

All the valleys are buried; they are up to 39 km long, 3-4 km wide and up to 350 m deep. The valleys are part of a vast tunnel valley province covering an area of some 0.5 million km2 of the formerly glaciated lowland areas of North West Europe. The valleys consist of non-branching, non-anastomosing troughs; they exhibit strongly undulating bottom profiles with numerous sub-basins and thresholds, and are characterised by adverse end slopes. Cross-cutting relationships and theoretical considerations suggest the occurrence of seven major episodes of valley incision attributed to ice marginal oscillations within a few glacials. Calculations considering the valley end gradients and theoretical ice-surface profiles suggest that the valleys were formed by pressurised subglacial meltwater erosion. Given a range of theoretical ice-surface profiles, the adverse end slopes are well beyond the supercooling threshold, which suggests that the water was not in thermal equilibrium with the basal ice and that flow was concentrated in substantial conduits with sufficient mass and flux to maintain water temperature well above the freezing point.

The change in character of the magnetic field on the continental margin on either side of the Atlantic from a landward magnetic quiet zone to a seaward "noisy", magnetic signature is postulated to be related to a change from continental to oceanic crust. Sea-floor spreading between Ireland and Newfoundland was initiated during the long normal geomagnetic polarity interval in the Late Cretaceous. Rockall Trough may have opened at this time. At the end of the normal polarity interval (Late Santonian) the ridge axis jumped westward to bypass Rockall Trough and the related offset initiated the Charlie Gibbs fracture zone. A reconstruction is presented for the relative position between North America and Europe prior to the initiation of sea-floor spreading in the Late Cretaceous. {\copyright} 1978.},

Four geological parameters including rock quality designation (RQD), depth index (DI), gouge content designation (GCD), and lithology permeability index (LPI) were adopted for establishing the empirical HC model. To verify rationality of the proposed HC model, 22 in-situ hydraulic tests were carried out to measure the hydraulic conductivity of the highly disturbed clastic sedimentary rocks in three boreholes at two different locations in Taiwan. Besides, the model verification using another borehole data with four additional in-situ hydraulic tests from similar clastic sedimentary rocks was also conducted to further verify the feasibility of the proposed empirical HC model. The field results indicated that the rock mass in the study area has a conductivity between the order of 10- 10 m/s and 10- 6 m/s at the depth between 34 m and 275 m below ground surface. Results demonstrate that the empirical HC model may provide a useful tool to predict hydraulic conductivity of the highly disturbed clastic sedimentary rocks in Taiwan based on measured HC-values. {\copyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Whereas the melting zone extends up to several hundreds of km laterally, the extrusion area at the spreading axis is confined to a narrow belt of only 2--3km width. The mechanism of melt focussing and extraction from the mantle beneath mid-ocean ridges is still poorly understood, despite the important role of the process for the formation of crust and plate tectonics. Using numerical simulations, we study the ascent paths of magma-filled dykes under different stress conditions. In contrast to early models, we have considered effects of stress and pressure gradients, buoyancy and enclosed finite fluid mass. The passive motion of the mantle due to the plate spreading has been modelled assuming an isothermal 2-D corner flow. An isotropic dynamic pressure is produced as well as a deviatoric stress field. While the dynamic pressure field is able to focus the fracture movement strongly towards the ridge axis, the deviatoric stress has a weak focussing effect and the apparent buoyancy counteracts the focussing of melt. Thus, we find that the simple stress field generated by a passive corner flow cannot explain convergent ascent paths, independent of the mantle rock viscosity chosen. This study concludes that an additional mechanism is necessary to explain the observed focussing of melt beneath mid-ocean spreading axes, e.g. large magma reservoirs or permeability barriers. The observed focussing might be explained without the demand for more complex flow models.}

  abstract = {The present work contributes to the study of heat-transfer mechanisms in crystalline bedrock. We present evidence from a thoroughly investigated case history in Outokumpu, eastern Finland, in the Fennoscandian (or Baltic) Shield, which shows that the subsurface temperature field is controlled by the thermal conductivity structure and downward diffusion of palaeoclimatic ground-temperature variations. The subsurface temperature profiles from three continuously cored boreholes (790--1100m deep) were used for a detailed 2-D modelling of structural, hydrogeological and palaeoclimatic effects on the subsurface temperature field. The boreholes are situated in a subdued topography and they intersect Early Precambrian folded lithologies, such as mica gneisses, black schists, skarn rocks, quartzites and serpentinite-talc rocks. Finite-difference techniques were used in the numerical solution of the heat- and mass-transport equations. The 2-D models of thermal conductivity and hydraulic permeability that were compiled were based on an extensive set of data relating to geological structure, in situ hydraulic permeability, groundwater composition and thermal conductivity of drill-core samples down to about 1 km depth. It was found that the thermal effect of topographically driven groundwater convection is very small, with Peclet numbers typically of the order of 10-4-10-5. The effect of anisotropy of thermal conductivity was found to be one order of magnitude smaller than the effects of heat-flow refraction in the inclined rock layers which produce horizontal components of heat-flow density ranging from -15 to 5 mW m-2 (basal heat flow 35 mW m-2). Since the advective heat transfer could be neglected, we tried to find a palaeoclimatic ground-temperature history that would explain the measured data. First, an inversion algorithm based on heat conduction in laterally homogeneous media was used for the reconstruction of palaeoclimatic ground-temperature history, but it yielded spurious results because of the strong 2-D conductivity effects. The only means to reconstruct the past ground-temperature changes was forward modelling using a conductive transient 2-D model with time-dependent surface-temperature variations. The surface temperatures at different times (between 100 000 yr BP and the present) and the basal heat-flow density were varied in order to reach a reasonable fit between the modelled and measured borehole temperatures. To reach this goal, the ground-temperature history must include the main climatic events during the last 100 000 yr, such as the last glacial epoch and the Little Ice Age (from about 1300 AD to 1700 AD), followed by warmer temperatures in more recent times. Our results suggests that subsurface temperatures in conditions similar to those of the Outokumpu case can yield a wealth of palaeoclimatic information when an appropriate approach for modelling heat transfer in the bedrock is chosen.},

However, the ultimate origin of the magmatism, i.e. why mantle plumes could have been generated at the MTZ, remains unclear. Here, we study the buoyancy of a plume by investigating basalts from the Changbaishan volcano, beneath which a mantle plume from the hydrous MTZ is observed via seismology. Based on carefully determined water contents of the basalts, the potential temperature of the source mantle is estimated to be 1310--1400 {$^\circ$}C, which is within the range of the normal upper mantle temperature. This observation suggests that the mantle plume did not have a significant excess heat, and that the plume upwelled because of buoyancy resulting from water supplied from the Pacific slab in the MTZ. Such a hydrous mantle plume can account for the formation of extremely hydrous LIP magmatism. The water was originally sourced from a stagnant slab and stored in the MTZ, and then upwelled irrespective of the presence or absence of a deep thermal plume.},

Geochemical analyses of basalts erupted above the mantle transition zone in northeast China indicate that water may have been added to this zone during the dehydration of subducted slabs, on two separate occasions over the past one billion years. The mantle transition zone, located at depths of 410--660 km between the lower and upper mantle, is an important water reservoir in the Earth's interior1,2,3,4. However, there are regional-scale heterogeneities in the distribution of water4,5. The zone beneath northeast China, in particular, is remarkably hydrous4, but when and how it became hydrous remains uncertain. Here we combine analyses of the geochemistry of late Cenozoic basalts in northeast China with published geochemical analyses. We find a spatial correlation between basalt geochemistry and the distribution of a low-velocity zone in the underlying mantle that is interpreted as a plume upwelling from the mantle transition zone6. We therefore use the basalt geochemistry to infer the composition of the mantle transition zone. The basalts have high Ba/Th and 207Pb/206Pb ratios, which we suggest record an ancient hydration event in the transition zone that occurred more than one billion years ago, probably as a result of dehydration of a subducted slab. We suggest that this ancient hydration event, combined with a more recent hydration event linked to dehydration of the subducted Pacific slab7, can account for the hydrous nature of the mantle transition zone beneath China. Our results demonstrate that the mantle transition zone can remain as a stable water reservoir in Earth's interior for timescales of more than a billion years.},

  abstract = {The opening of the Central Atlantic Ocean basin that separated North America from northwest Africa is well documented and assumed to have started during the Late Jurassic. However, the early evolution and the initial breakup history of Pangaea are still debated: most of the existing models are based on one or multiple ridge jumps at the Middle Jurassic leaving the oldest crust on the American side, between the East Coast Magnetic Anomaly (ECMA) and the Blake Spur Magnetic Anomaly (BSMA). According to these hypotheses, the BSMA represents the limit of the initial basin and the footprint subsequent to the ridge jump. Consequently, the evolution of the northwest African margin is widely different from the northeast American margin. However, this setting is in contradiction with the existing observations. In this paper, we propose an alternative scenario for the continental breakup and the Mesozoic spreading history of the Central Atlantic Ocean. The new model is based on an analysis of geophysical data (including new seismic lines, an interpretation of the newly compiled magnetic data, and satellite derived gravimetry) and recently published results which demonstrate that the opening of the Central Atlantic Ocean started already during the Late Sinemurian (190. Ma), based on a new identification of the African conjugate to the ECMA and on the extent of salt provinces off Morocco and Nova Scotia. The identification of an African conjugate magnetic anomaly to BSMA, the African Blake Spur Magnetic Anomaly (ABSMA), together with the significant change in basement topography, are in good agreement with that initial reconstruction. The early opening history for the Central Atlantic Ocean is described in four distinct phases. During the first 20. Myr after the initial breakup (190-170. Ma, from Late Sinemurian to early Bajocian), oceanic accretion was extremely slow ({$\sim$}. 0.8. cm/y). At the time of Blake Spur (170. Ma, early Bajocian), a drastic change occurred both in the relative plate motion direction (from NNW-SSE to NW-SE) and in the spreading rate (an increase to {$\sim$}. 1.7. cm/y). After a small increase between Chron M25 ({$\sim$}. 154. Ma, Kimmeridgian) and Chron M22 ({$\sim$}. 150. Ma, Tithonian), the spreading rate slowed down to about 1.3. cm/y and remained fairly constant until Chron M0 (125. Ma, Barremian-Aptian boundary). In addition, kinematic reconstructions illustrate a significant spreading asymmetry during the early history of the Central Atlantic Ocean; the accretion rates were higher on the American side and led to the formation of more oceanic crust on this plate. We infer that this asymmetry could be related to the fact that the thermal anomaly responsible for the significant magmatism of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) was preferentially located below the African plate. {\copyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {We estimated the bathymetry and sediment thickness of a remote and difficult to access portion of the Antarctic continental margin using aerogeophysical surveying techniques. The U.S., Argentina, Chile aerogeophysical survey collected magnetic and gravity data over the basins surrounding the Antarctic Peninsula. Thirty-seven of these flight lines were used to estimate bathymetry and depth to magnetic basement for the western Weddell Basin. A wavenumber technique was applied to individual magnetic anomaly profiles in an automated fashion to obtain estimates of the depth to magnetic basement. The bathymetric estimates were obtained by admittance inversions of the gravity field. The results were then gridded at a 40-km interval for the region 64 degrees W, 44 degrees W, 73 degrees S, and 62 degrees S. Bathymetric estimates and depth to magnetic basement estimates were differenced at each grid point to obtain a regional estimate of the thickness of nonmagnetic overburden (assumed to be sediment). Subsequent spot measurements of topography in the estimated region of the continental margin generally agree to about 52 m. The estimated magnetic basement deepens from the Antarctic Peninsula margin eastward to a maximum of 10-12 km near 54 degrees W. We also postulate the existence of two moderately large basins flanking the eastward continuation of the Jason Peninsula. Farther east, the basement steps upward, with a correspondent thinning of the sedimentary layer. Along the east coast of the peninsula, results agree well with seismic studies on James Ross Island and magnetotelluric studies on Marambio Island and the Larsen nunatak, as well as the British Antarctic Survey basement estimates from aeromagnetic data. This study further demonstrates the utility of combined application of airborne and satellite geophysical techniques in the study of structure and tectonic evolution of continental margins and marine basins.},

The constraint that this places on the characteristics of mantle convection in the past are investigated using the global heat balance equation and a simple parameterization for the heat loss of the Earth. All heat loss parameterization schemes depend on a closure equation for the maximum age of oceanic plates.We use a scheme that accounts for the present-day distribution of heat flux at Earth's surface and that does not depend on any assumption about the dynamics of convection with rigid plates, which remain poorly understood.We show that heat supply to the base of continents and transient continental thermal regimes cannot be ignored. We find that the maximum sea floor age has not changed by large amounts over the last 3 Ga. Calculations lead to a maximum temperature at an age of about 3 Ga and cannot be extrapolated further back in time. By construction, these calculations are based on the present-day tectonic regime characterized by the subduction of large oceanic plates and hence indicate that this regime did not prevail until an age of about 3 Ga. According to this interpretation, the onset of rapid continental growth occurred when the current plate regime became stable.},

  abstract = {To investigate simplified relations between elevation and the extensional, magmatic and thermal processes that influence lithosphere buoyancy, we assume that the lithosphere floats on an asthenosphere of uniform density and has no flexural strength. A simple graph relating elevation to lithosphere density and thickness provides an overview of expectable conditions around the earth and a simple test for consistancy of continental and oceanic lithosphere models. The mass-balance relations yield simple general rules for estimating elevation changes caused by various tectonic, magmatic and thermal processes without referring to detailed models. The rules are general because they depend principally on buoyancy, which under our assumptions is specified by elevation, a known quantity; they do not generally require a knowledge of lithosphere thickness and density. The elevation of an extended terrain contains important information on its tectonic and magmatic history. In the Great Basin where Cenozoic extension is estimated to be 100\%, the present high mean elevation ( {$\sim$} 1.75 km) probably requires substantial low-density magmatic contributions to the extending lithosphere. The elevation cannot be reasonably explained solely as the buoyant residue of a very high initial terrane, or of a lithosphere that was initially very thick and subsequently delaminated and heated. Even models with a high initial elevation typically call for 10 km or so of accumulated magmatic material of near-crustal density. To understand the evolution of the Great Basin, it is important to determine whether such intruded material is present; some could replenish the stretching crust by underplating and crustal intrusion and some might reside in the upper mantle. The elevation maintained or approached by an intruded extending lithosphere depends on the ratio B of how fast magma is supplied from the asthenosphere ( b km/Ma) to how fast the lithosphere spreads the magma out by extension ({$\gamma$} Ma-1). For a surface maintained 2 1 2km below sea level (e.g., an ocean ridge) B is about 5 km; for continental extension the ratio may be much greater. The frequent association of volcanism with continental extension, the high elevation (and buoyancy) of some appreciably extended terrains, and the oceanic spreading analog all suggest that magmatism may play an important role in continental extension. Better estimates of total extension and elevation change in extended regions can help to identify that role. {\copyright} 1990.},

  abstract = {The elevations and chronology of interglacial shorelines and other sea-level indicators provide information on ice volumes for these earlier periods compared with today. But, as for the Holocene, the relationship between sea levels and ice volumes for earlier interglacials is not simple because of the planet's deformational, gravitational and rotational response to changes in ice-water loads (glacio-hydro isostasy). In particular, the pattern of global sea level for a particular interglacial will be a function of the earth and ocean response to ice loads applied before, during and after the interglacial in question. This paper examines the role of glacio-hydro isostasy during these glacial cycles to make three key points. The first is to demonstrate why interglacial sea levels cannot be interpreted directly in terms of ice volume. The second is to illustrate the spatial variability that can be expected in interglacial sea levels because of the Earth's isostatic response to changing ice and water loads and to demonstrate why observations from different localities should not be combined into a single sea-level function without first correcting for differential isostatic effects. The third addresses the question whether, in the absence of perfect knowledge of the ice sheets and earth rheology, inferences can be made about ice volumes during an interglacial. We conclude that if these isostatic factors are ignored, interpretations of interglacial sea levels can lead to serious errors in the inferences about ice volumes during the interglacials.},

  abstract = {Significance             Several areas of earth science require knowledge of the fluctuations in sea level and ice volume through glacial cycles. These include understanding past ice sheets and providing boundary conditions for paleoclimate models, calibrating marine-sediment isotopic records, and providing the background signal for evaluating anthropogenic contributions to sea level. From {$\sim$}1,000 observations of sea level, allowing for isostatic and tectonic contributions, we have quantified the rise and fall in global ocean and ice volumes for the past 35,000 years. Of particular note is that during the {$\sim$}6,000 y up to the start of the recent rise {$\sim$}100-150 y ago, there is no evidence for global oscillations in sea level on time scales exceeding {$\sim$}200 y duration or 15-20 cm amplitude.           ,                             The major cause of sea-level change during ice ages is the exchange of water between ice and ocean and the planet's dynamic response to the changing surface load. Inversion of {$\sim$}1,000 observations for the past 35,000 y from localities far from former ice margins has provided new constraints on the fluctuation of ice volume in this interval. Key results are: (               i               ) a rapid final fall in global sea level of {$\sim$}40 m in {$<$}2,000 y at the onset of the glacial maximum {$\sim$}30,000 y before present (30 ka BP); (               ii               ) a slow fall to -134 m from 29 to 21 ka BP with a maximum grounded ice volume of {$\sim$}52 {\texttimes} 10               6               km               3               greater than today; (               iii               ) after an initial short duration rapid rise and a short interval of near-constant sea level, the main phase of deglaciation occurred from {$\sim$}16.5 ka BP to {$\sim$}8.2 ka BP at an average rate of rise of 12 m{$\cdot$}ka               -1               punctuated by periods of greater, particularly at 14.5--14.0 ka BP at {$\geq$}40 mm{$\cdot$}y               -1               (MWP-1A), and lesser, from 12.5 to 11.5 ka BP (Younger Dryas), rates; (               iv               ) no evidence for a global MWP-1B event at {$\sim$}11.3 ka BP; and (               v               ) a progressive decrease in the rate of rise from 8.2 ka to {$\sim$}2.5 ka BP, after which ocean volumes remained nearly constant until the renewed sea-level rise at 100--150 y ago, with no evidence of oscillations exceeding {$\sim$}15--20 cm in time intervals {$\geq$}200 y from 6 to 0.15 ka BP.},

Recently, the procedures used by the group at the Australian National University (ANU) for the hydro-isostatic component of the theory have been questioned (Quat. Sci. Rev. 21 (2002) 409) although the details of the ANU group's procedures have not been published because they are mainly computational in nature rather than representing significant conceptual advances. Because of this criticism, we set out here in detail the procedures that have been used for the treatment of the migration of shorelines as sea levels rise and fall, the effect of retreat and advancing grounded ice on shelves and shallow seas, and the transitions from grounded to floating ice (and vice versa). We conclude that there is no basis for the criticism, that these formulations and their implementation provide a high resolution and complete description of both sea-level change and of the estimates of volumes of ice exchanged with the oceans. The results from this formulation are confirmed by the entirely independent analyses of Milne et al. (Quat. Sci. Rev. 21 (2002) 361) and Mitrovica and Milne (Geophys. J. Int.

  abstract = {The observed variations in the thickness of the conductive lithosphere, derived from surface wave studies, have a first-order control on the elevation of the continents, in addition to variations in the thickness of the crust---this defines whole lithosphere isostasy (WLI). Negative buoyancy of the mantle lithosphere counters the positive buoyancy of the crust, and together, their respective thicknesses and density contrasts determine elevation of the continents both in their interiors and at their edges. The average density contrasts for lithospheric mantle with crust and with asthenosphere are typically 300 to 550 and 20 to 40 kg m-3, respectively, with a ratio 10 to 16, suggesting moderate average depletion of lithospheric mantle. We show that a crustal model for Antarctica, assuming WLI and using these density contrasts, provides a close fit to estimates of crustal thickness from surface wave tomography and gravity observations. We use a global model of WLI as a framework to assess factors controlling topography, showing that plausible regional variations in crustal and mantle densities, together with uncertainties in the crustal and conductive lithospheric thicknesses, are sufficient to account for global elevations without invoking dynamic topography greater than a few hundred meters. Estimates of elastic thickness Te in the continents are typically 25--50\% of the thickness of the conductive lithosphere, indicating that the mantle part supports some of the elastic strength of the lithosphere.},

Kumar et al., The lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary in the North-West Atlantic region, Earth Planet. Sci. Lett. 236 (2005) 249-257.] that also caused the evolution of the British Tertiary volcanic province (BTVP) with the Giant's Causeway basalts as famous landmark. Using teleseismic shear-wave receiver functions we map the LAB underneath Ireland and find a distinctive lithospheric thinning of about 30 km towards the northern part of the island. As this region is part of the BTVP, we explain the lithospheric thinning, in agreement with geochemical results, by thermal erosion originating from the head of the proto-Iceland plume. {\copyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Data from 11 seismic refraction profiles reveal that onshore Ireland mean crustal velocities range between 6.25 and 6.5 km s(-1) with crustal thickness of 28.5-32 km. Superimposed on a three-layer crust, the sedimentary layer has a thickness of approximately 6-8 km at the southern coastline, but only 3-4 km in the vicinity of the Shannon Estuary in western Ireland. The lateral heterogeneity of the upper-crustal layer is pervasive throughout Ireland, with velocities of 5.7-6.2 km s(-1) and a layer thickness of 3-10 km. A low-velocity zone is found in the south-east which is interpreted as the buried south-western extension of the Leinster Granite. The mid-crustal layer (6.3-6.7 km s(-1)) is between 8 and 16 km thick. Significant changes occur in the vicinity of the Shannon Estuary, around the location of the Iapetus Suture Zone. The lower crust is fairly uniform with velocities of 6.8-7.2 km s(-1) and a thickness of approximately 8-10 km except towards the south of Ireland where the Moho appears as a transition zone. Offshore Ireland, a two-layer crust with a thickness of 24-26 km beneath the North Celtic Sea Basin and only 14-15 km beneath the Rockall Trough prevails.},

As part of the seismic experiment a 200 km long wide-angle seismic profile (Line A) was recorded from the Old Head of Kinsale in the south of Ireland to Galway Bay on the west coast. Along Line A, 170 seismic stations were deployed at approximately I km intervals. Results from ray trace modelling indicate a multilayered crust, The upper crust, extending to a depth of about 14 km, is laterally variable. South of the Shannon Estuary sedimentary basins alternate with uplifted basement (5.8-6.0 km s(-1)). This correlates well with the surface geology. The larger sedimentary basin in the south reveals a shallowly south-dipping structural feature that coincides with the Killarney-Mallow Fault Zone. North of the Shannon Estuary surprisingly high velocities (6.4 km s(-1)) at shallow depths were observed. Between the upper and middle crust there is a transition layer about 2-4 km thick. The middle crust thickens towards the Shannon Estuary. These structural changes coincide with the proposed location of the Iapetus Suture Zone. The middle crust is underlain by a lower crust with a variable velocity structure, and the total crustal thickness varies from 29-32 km, Detailed traveltime investigations have also revealed a reflector in the upper mantle at depths between 39 and 44 km. The seismic model shows that there are no deep crustal variations beneath the Killarney-Mallow Fault Zone, indicating a thin-skinned mechanism of deformation.},

This is due in large part to microbial activity in the shallower layers and abiotic reactions resulting from increasing temperatures and pressures at greater depths. Quantifying the rates of these diagenetic changes requires a three-dimensional description of the physiochemical properties of marine sediments. In a step toward reaching this goal, we have combined global data sets describing bathymetry, heat conduction, bottom-water temperatures, and sediment thickness to quantify the three-dimensional distribution of temperature in marine sediments. This model has revealed that {$\sim$}35\% of sediments are above 60 {$^\circ$}C, conditions that are suitable for petroleum generation. Furthermore, significant microbial activity could be inhibited in {$\sim$}25\% of marine sediments, if 80 {$^\circ$}C is taken as a major thermal barrier for subsurface life. In addition to a temperature model, we have calculated new values for the total volume (3.01 {\texttimes} 108 km3) and average thickness (721 m) of marine sediments, and provide the only known determination of the volume of marine-sediment pore water (8.46 {\texttimes} 107 km3), equivalent to {$\sim$}6.3\% of the volume of the ocean. The results presented here can be used to help quantify the rates of mineral transformations, lithification, catagenesis, and the extent of life in the subsurface on a global scale.}

Our goal here is to compare quantitatively mechanisms involving deformation of the inner core and build a regime diagram giving the dominant mechanism as a function of key control parameters. A meaningful comparison between the different mechanisms requires the definition of a measure of the strength of the flow, and we choose here to compare this mechanisms in terms of the instantaneous strain rate, and consider that the dominant mechanism is the one which induces the highest strain rates at a given time. Using scaling laws for all proposed mechanisms, we build regime diagrams giving the dominant mechanisms as a function of control parameters including the sign and strength of the density stratification in Earth's inner core, its viscosity, and magnetic field strength. We find that only specific regions of the diagram have a dominant regime potentially consistent with the seismological observed geometry and strength of the inner core anisotropy.},

  abstract = {Our new 1-by-1 degree global crustal model, CRUST1.0, was introduced last year and serves as starting model in a comprehensive effort to compile a global model of Earth's crust and lithosphere, LITHO1.0 (Pasyanos et al., 2012). The Moho depth in CRUST1.0 is based on 1-degree averages of a recently updated database of crustal thickness data from active source seismic studies as well as from receiver function studies. In areas where such constraints are still missing, for example in Antarctica, crustal thicknesses are estimated using gravity constraints. The compilation of the new crustal model initially followed the philosophy of the widely used crustal model CRUST2.0 (Bassin et al., 2000; http://igppweb.ucsd.edu/{\textasciitilde}gabi/crust2.html) to assign elastic properties in the crystalline crust according to basement age or tectonic setting (loosely following an updated map by Artemieva and Mooney (2001; http://www.lithosphere.info). For cells with no local seismic or gravity constraints, statistical averages of crustal properties, including crustal thickness, were extrapolated. However, in places with constraints the depth to basement and mantle are given explicitly and no longer assigned by crustal type. This allows for much smaller errors in both. In each 1-degree cell, boundary depth, compressional and shear velocity as well as density is given for 8 layers: water, ice, 3 sediment layers and upper, middle and lower crystalline crust. Topography, bathymetry and ice cover are taken from ETOPO1. The sediment cover is based on our sediment model (Laske and Masters, 1997; http://igppweb.ucsd.edu/{\textasciitilde}sediment.html), with some near-coastal updates. In an initial step toward LITHO1.0, the model is then validated against new global surface wave disperison maps and adjusted in areas of extreme misfit. This poster presents the next validation step: compare the new Moho depths with in-situ active source and receiver function results. We also present comparisons with CRUST2.0. CRUST1.0 is available for download.

The {$\epsilon$} Sr (413), {$\epsilon$} Nd (413) and {$\delta$} 18 O values for the KQM range from 56.3 to 120.0, 2.8 to - 6.4, and 7.6‚Ä∞to 129‚Ä∞, respectively; values for the BG range from 7.4 to 144.7, 0.6 to -9.3, and 8.3‚Ä∞ to 11.3‚Ä∞, respectively; and values for possible source rocks range from 38.1 to 654.2, - 10.7 to 5.4. and 6.2‚Ä∞ to 14.1‚Ä∞, respectively. Both the BG and KQM have extremely heterogeneous initial isotopic compositions consistent with mixing of multiple crustal source rocks, and neither contains a volumetrically significant (i.e.,{$\geq$} 10\%) mantlederived component. Overlapping values of {$\epsilon$} Nd (413), {$\epsilon$} Sr (413) and {$\delta$} 18 O values for both the BG and KQM samples resemble values for metasedimentary host rocks of the CMT and BHA. We observe no systematic correlations between {$\epsilon$} Nd and {$\epsilon$} Sr values for either the BG or the KQM. The {$\epsilon$} Sr and {$\delta$} 18 O values for the BG do not form any simple mixing trends, nor is there any direct correlation between the isotopic compositions of contact BG samples and their adjacent host rocks, in contrast to our observations for the KQM (Lathrop et al. 1994). We propose that the KQM and BG magmas were generated through anatexis of metasedimentary rocks from both the BHA and CMT in response to crystal thickening during the Acadian orogeny. Melting may have been initiated within CMT metasediments in response to high heat production in these mid-crustal rocks combined with crustal thickening, whereas melting of BHA rocks with normal crustal heat production, which were located at lower-crustal levels than CMT rocks, is likely to have been driven by crustal thickening alone. Following upward advection of mobile BHA magmas, BHA- and CMT-derived magmas may have mingled during complex Acadian deformation in the CMT. thus accounting for the isotopic similarities we observe between the BG and the KQM.}

  abstract = {Seismological detections of complex structures in the lowermost mantle boundary layer (the D ??? region) motivate a conceptual model of a compositionally stratified thermo-chemical boundary layer (TCBL) within which lateral temperature variations (sustained by large-scale mid-mantle flow) cause variations of partial melt fraction. Partial melt fractions of from 0 to 30\% in the TCBL occur due to the eutectic of the boundary layer material lying below the high temperature at the core-mantle boundary (CMB), coupled with the presence of steep thermal gradients across the boundary layer. Regions of the TCBL with the highest temperatures have extensive partial melting, producing lateral chemical variations and strong effects on seismic velocities and boundary layer dynamics. This TCBL concept provides a relatively simple framework that can plausibly account for diverse seismological observations such as: predominance of large-scale volumetric elastic wave velocity heterogeneity in the boundary layer, laterally extensive, but intermittent abrupt shear and compressional velocity increases and decreases at the top of the D ??? region, small-scale topography of D ??? velocity discontinuities, thin ultra-low velocity zones at the CMB, widespread shear wave anisotropy in D???, bulk sound velocity anomalies detected in low shear velocity regions of D???, and large-scale upwellings from the most extensively melted regions of the boundary layer. Neutral or negative buoyancy of the partial melt in the TCBL is required, along with an increase in bulk modulus and some density increase of the boundary layer material relative to the overlying mantle. More complex models, in which the partially melted chemical boundary layer is laterally displaced by mid-mantle downwellings are also viable, but these appear to require additional special circumstances, such as a phase change, efficient segregation of slab crustal material, or abrupt onset of anisotropy, in order to account for rapid velocity increases at the top of D???. The precise nature of the compositional anomaly, or anomalies, in D??? and the eutectic composition of this zone are yet to be determined, but it appears likely that partial melting within the lowermost mantle plays a paramount role in the observed seismic velocity heterogeneity. Increased resolution geodynamic calculations of dense boundary layer structures with partial melting (and attendant viscosity reductions and chemical heterogeneity) are needed to quantify this TCBL concept. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Depth distributions of seismic velocities and their directional dependence (anisotropy) in the crust and mantle beneath cratons yield essential constraints on processes of their formation and evolution. Despite recent progress in mapping the lateral extent of cratonic roots around the globe, profiles of seismic velocities within them remain uncertain. In this study we employ a novel combination of waveform-analysis techniques and measure inter-station Rayleigh- and Love-wave phase velocities in broad period ranges that enable resolution from the upper crust to deep upper mantle. Sampling a selection of 10 Archean and Proterozoic locations, we derive new constraints on the isotropic and radially anisotropic seismic structure of Precambrian lithosphere. Shear-wave speed V (sub S) is consistently higher in the lithosphere of cratons than in the lithosphere of Proterozoic foldbelts. Because known effects of compositional variations in the lithosphere on V (sub S) are too small to account for the difference, this implies that temperature in cratonic lithosphere is consistently lower, in spite of sub-lithospheric mantle beneath continents being thermally heterogeneous, with some cratons underlain, as we observe, by a substantially hotter asthenosphere compared to others. Lithospheric geotherms being nearly conductive, this confirms that the stable, buoyant lithosphere beneath cratons must be substantially thicker than beneath younger continental blocks. An increase in V (sub S) between the Moho and a 100-150 km depth is consistently preferred by the data in this study and is present in seismic models of continents published previously. We argue that this is largely due to the transition from spinel peridotite to garnet peridotite, proposed previously to give rise to the "Hales discontinuity" within this depth interval. The depth and the width of the phase transformation depend on mantle composition; it is likely to occur deeper and over a broader depth interval beneath cratons than elsewhere because of the high Cr content in the depleted cratonic lithosphere, as evidenced by a number of xenolith studies. Seismic data available at present would be consistent with both a sharp and a gradual increase in V (sub S) in the upper lithosphere (a Hales discontinuity or a "Hales gradient"). The V (sub S) profile in the upper mantle lithosphere is not shaped by the temperature distribution only; this needs to be considered when relating seismic velocities to lithospheric temperatures. Radial anisotropy in the upper crust is observed repeatedly and indicates vertically oriented anisotropic fabric (V (sub SH) {\textbackslash}textgreaterV (sub SV) ); this may yield a clue on how cratons grew, lending support to the view that distributed crustal shortening with sub-vertical flow patterns occurred over large scales in hot ancient orogens. In the lower crust and upper lithospheric mantle, radial anisotropy consistently reveals horizontal fabric (V (sub SH) {\textbackslash}textgreaterV (sub SV) ); the fabric can be interpreted as a record of (sub-)horizontal ductile flow in the lower crust and lithospheric mantle at the time of the formation and stabilisation of the cratons. We also find indications for radial anisotropy below 200 km depth, corroborating recent evidence for anisotropy in the asthenosphere beneath cratons due to current and recent asthenospheric flow.},

Baddeleyite fractions from four widely-spaced Mackenzie diabases define a single discordia line with an upper intercept age of 1267 \_+ 2 Ma. The dyke age of 1267 Ma provides a precise time-marker for much of the northwestern Canadian Shield. Mackenzie intrusive events were coeval with eruption of Coppermine River flood basalts in the Coppermine homocline. The short time-span, large volume and specific focus of Mackenzie igneous events suggest that magmatism occurred above a large hotspot caused by the presence of a mantle plume. We infer that magmatism was initiated when rifting breached a large domal uplift supported by the plume-generated hotspot. The uplift-subsidence record in the Coppermine homocline is predicted by numerical models for rifting above hot asthenospheric mantle leading to ocean opening. An array of five large gravity anomalies north of the homocline may outline a region of stretched continental crust extensively intruded by Mackenzie mafic igneous bodies.}

  abstract = {Human activity causes vibrations that propagate into the ground as high-frequency seismic waves. Measures to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic caused widespread changes in human activity, leading to a months-long reduction in seismic noise of up to 50\%. The 2020 seismic noise quiet period is the longest and most prominent global anthropogenic seismic noise reduction on record. While the reduction is strongest at surface seismometers in populated areas, this seismic quiescence extends for many kilometers radially and hundreds of meters in depth. This provides an opportunity to detect subtle signals from subsurface seismic sources that would have been concealed in noisier times and to benchmark sources of anthropogenic noise. A strong correlation between seismic noise and independent measurements of human mobility suggests that seismology provides an absolute, real-time estimate of population dynamics.},

  abstract = {We develop an algorithm to invert geophysical magnetic data to recover 3-D distributions of subsurface magnetic susceptibility when the bodies have complicated geometry and possibly high magnetic susceptibility. For the associated forward modelling problem, a full solution to Maxwell's equations for source-free magnetostatics is developed in the differential equation domain using a finite volume discretization. The earth region of interest is discretized into many prismatic cells, each with constant susceptibility. The resulting system of discrete equations is solved using an ILU-preconditioned Bi-Conjugate Gradient Stabilized (BiCGStab) algorithm. Formulations for total and secondary field computations are developed and tested against analytic solutions and against a solution in the integral equation domain. The finite volume forward modelling method forms the foundation for a subsequent inversion algorithm. The underdetermined inverse problem is solved as an unconstrained optimization problem and an objective function composed of data misfit and a regularization term is minimized using a Gauss-Newton search. At each iteration, the CGLS algorithm is used to solve for the search direction. The inversion code is tested on synthetic data from both geometrically simple and complicated bodies and on field survey data collected over a planted ferrous shipping container.},

  abstract = {The thermal structure of continental crust is a critical factor for geothermal exploration, hydrocarbon maturation and crustal strength, and yet our understanding of it is limited by our incomplete knowledge of its geological structure and thermal properties such as hydrogeologic and thermo-mechanical feedbacks that come into play. One of the most critical parameters in modelling upper crustal temperature is thermal conductivity, which itself exhibits strong temperature dependence. In this study, we integrate new laboratory measurements of the thermal conductivity of Sydney Basin rocks under varying temperatures, with finite-element geothermal models of the Sydney Basin using deal.II (Bangerth et al. in ACM Trans Math Softw (TOMS) 33:24, 2007). Basin geometry and structure are adapted from Danis et al. (Aust J Earth Sci 58:517--42, 2011), which quantified the extent of Triassic sediment, Permian coal measures, Carboniferous volcanics and thickness of the crystalline crust. We find that temperature-dependent thermal conductivity results in lower lateral variations in temperature compared to constant thermal conductivity models. However, the average temperatures at depth are significantly higher when temperature-dependent thermal conductivity effects are included. A number of regions within the Sydney Basin demonstrate temperatures above 150 {$^\circ$}C at depths of less than 2000 m in these models, for instance NW of Singleton, exhibits a strong thermal anomaly, demonstrating the potential for geothermal prospectivity of the region from experimentally constrained thermal parameters.}

  abstract = {We explore the possibility that an increase in the surface temperature of a terrestrial planet due to an enhanced concentration of atmospheric greenhouse gasses and/or increased solar luminosity could initiate a transition from an active-lid mode of mantle convection (e.g., plate tectonics) to an episodic or stagnant-lid mode (i.e., single plate planet). A scaling theory is developed to estimate the required temperature change as a function of the temperature dependence of mantle viscosity and the yield stress of the lithosphere. The theory relies on the assumptions that convective stresses scale with mantle viscosity and that a planet will adjust to surface temperature changes so as to maintain a surface heat flow that balances internal heat production. The theory is tested against a suite of numerical simulations of mantle convection. The comparisons are favorable. The combined theory and numerics suggest that if the yield stress for the earths' lithosphere is 30--35~MPa, then a surface temperature change of 60--120{$^\circ$} could shut down an active-lid mode of convection assuming present day conditions. Lower values are predicted for higher yield stresses and for earlier times in the earth geologic evolution.},

  abstract = {Although Mars is currently not tectonically active, it may have experienced plate tectonics early in its history. The southern hemisphere of Mars possesses a thick crust which probably renders the lithosphere positively buoyant. In this paper we present numerical and scaling arguments which show that if the area of positively buoyant lithosphere grows beyond a critical fraction ({$\approx$}50\% for Mars), plate tectonics will stop. Heat transfer through the buoyant lithosphere is inefficient, which causes mean mantle temperatures to increase as the surface area of buoyant lithosphere increases. The resulting reduction in mantle viscosity reduces shear stresses; if these shear stresses drop below the yield strength of the lithosphere, plate motions will cease and the planet will behave as a one-plate system. Thus the end of plate tectonics on Mars is a natural consequence of the growth of the southern highlands. Similar arguments for the Earth predict that it should operate in the plate tectonic regime now but that it may have experienced stagnant lid convection in the past.},

Debate exists as to specific conditions that allow for habitability but the use of the term as a planetary variable has become ubiquitous. This paper poses a meta-level question: What type of variable is habitability? Is it akin to temperature, in that it is something that characterizes a planet, or is something that flows through a planet, akin to heat? That is, is habitability a state or a process variable? Forth coming observations can be used to discriminate between these end-member hypotheses. Each has different implications for the factors that lead to differences between planets (e.g. the differences between Earth and Venus). Observational tests can proceed independent of any new modelling of planetary habitability. However, the viability of habitability as a process can influence future modelling. We discuss a specific modelling framework based on anticipating observations that can discriminate between different views of habitability.},

  abstract = {The Archaean paradox stems from the fact that while certain lines of evidence suggest that Archaean continental geotherms were similar to those at present. other lines of evidence suggest that the average mantle heat flux was considerably greater. The simplest qualitative solution, which holds that a greater proportion of heat loss was carried by the creation and subduction of oceanic lithosphere in the Earth's past, has lacked a clear physical basis. At a fundamental level, it requires that the ratio of mantle heat loss below oceans to that below continents be an increasing function of overall convective vigour and, to date, no self-consistent model has been used to suggest a means by which this could be so. A simple means is suggested by models that allow accumulations of chemically light near-surface material, analogues to continents, to form within the upper thermal boundary layer of a thermally convecting and chemically dense fluid, an analogue to the mantle. The physical properties of continental crust cause the thermal coupling condition between a model continent and the convectively unstable mantle below to be different from that which exists at the interface between mantle and oceans. For the latter, a spatially constant temperature condition holds due to (1) the participation of oceanic crust in convective mantle overturn and (2) the large effective thermal conductivity of oceans relative to the mantle. For the former, a spatially near-constant equilibrium heat flux condition holds due to (1) the long-term stability of continental crust against remixing into the mantle and (2) the comparable thermal conductivities of distinct rock types. This leads to a laterally variable thermal condition at the surface of the convecting mantle, which, in turn, leads to different local mantle heat flux behaviour in continental versus oceanic regions. As a result, heat flux below continents can increase at a slower rate, with increasing convective vigour, than it does elsewhere. Model heat-flux scalings are used to assess the degree to which continental geotherms can be time-stabilized by this means. Results suggest that the thermal surface heterogeneity imposed on the mantle by the presence of continental crust can prevent wide-scale crustal melting in the Archaean by forcing oceans to carry a greater proportion of the Earth's heat-loss load in the past.},

  abstract = {A convective modelling procedure is presented which avoids the stability problems of central differencing while remaining free of the inaccuracies of numerical diffusion associated with upstream differencing. For combined convection and diffusion the number of operations at each grid point is comparable to that of standard upstream-pluscentral differencing - however, highly accurate solutions can be obtained with a grid spacing much larger than that required by conventional methods for comparable accuracy, with obvious practical advantaged in terms of both speed and storage. The algorithm is based on a conservative control-volume formulation with cell wall values of each field variable written in terms of a quadratic interpolation using in any one coordinate direction the two adjacent nodal values together with the value at the next upstream node. This results in a convective differencing scheme with greater formal accuracy than central differencing while retaining the basic stable convective sensitivity property of upstream-weighted schemes. The consistent treatment of diffusion terms is equivalent to central differencing. With careful modelling, numerical boundary conditions are not troublesome. Some idealized problems are studied, showing the practical advantages of the method over other schemes in comparison with exact solutions. An application to a complex unsteady two-dimensional flow is briefly discussed. ?? 1979.},

The Newfoundland fracture zone, which is a prolongation of the largest offset in the continental margin, constrained the movement of the separating continents to a single rotation, making adjustments mechanically difficult until the continental edges were separated by a distance of about twice the length of the largest offset. Using the trend of the Newfoundland, Bahama, and Guinea fracture zones, a pole of early opening was computed that is located 25{$^\circ$} away from the Newfoundland fracture zone at the northern limit of the basin and 50{$^\circ$} from the Bahama fracture zone at the southern limit. The total opening about this pole is 46{$^\circ$}. The other fracture zones approximately define concentric circles, and the magnetic discontinuities of Vogt et al. (1970) are isochron lines about this pole. About 80 m.y. ago, when the separated blocks no longer constrained movement, the early opening phase ended, and a complete reorganization occurred, resulting from a migration of the pole toward the north. The major physiographic differences between the mid-Atlantic ridge and the basin provinces can be explained by the rearrangement of the relative movements of the plates 80 m.y. ago.},

They provide data in poorly sampled regions near the core of the North American craton where one expects the lithosphere to be thickest. The new heat flux values are all smaller than 34 mW m (super -2) and are among the lowest recorded so far in the shield. For all the new sites, there is no relationship between heat flux and heat production in surface rocks. In the Canadian Shield, heat flux variations occur at wavelengths {\textbackslash}textless100 km and are mostly of crustal origin. Local averages in two 250 X 250 km windows located on Archean areas at high latitudes on either side of James Bay are 29 mW m (super -2) and 31 mW m (super -2) , the lowest values found so far at this scale in the Canadian Shield. S wave traveltime delays derived from tomographic models provide the additional constraints needed to resolve differences of deep lithospheric thermal structure. There is no significant correlation between average surface heat flux and traveltime delays within the Canadian Shield, confirming that variations of the surface heat flux are mostly of crustal origin. Traveltime delays cannot be explained by variations in crustal heat production only and require variations of heat supply to the lithosphere and/or radiogenic heat production in the lithospheric mantle. These variations are associated with changes of lithospheric thickness that may be as large as 80 km. The heat flux at the base of the Superior lithosphere is constrained to be 11 + or - 2 mW m (super -2) .},

In this way, smoothness and positivity are automatically imposed on the source without any subjective input from the user apart from selecting the number of functions to use. The algorithm has been tested with synthetic data in order to resolve sources at very different depths, using data from one measurement plane only. The forward modeling is based on prismatic cell parameterization, but the algebraic nonuniqueness is reduced because a relationship among the cells, expressed by the Gaussian envelope, is assumed to describe the spatial variation of the source distribution. We assume that there is no remanent magnetization and that the magnetic data are produced by induced magnetization only, neglecting any demagnetization effects. The algorithm proceeds by minimization of a {\^A}2 misfit function between real and predicted data using a nonlinear Levenberg-Marquardt iteration scheme, easily implemented on a desktop PC, without any additional regularization. We demonstrate the robustness and utility of the method using synthetic data corrupted by pseudorandom generated noise and a real field data set.},

In the framework of the SIM-CRUST project, five broadband seismic stations have been deployed in the same area between July and August 2013, with an inter-station distance of about 1km. This passive seismological experiment will test the possibility of retrieving the seismic stratigraphy of the shallow crust (0-10 km depth range) by means of the teleseismic Receiver Function (RF) method extended to high frequencies. The preliminary results obtained with the first 6 months of data show the presence of a high lateral variability of the seismic layering along the length of the array and the presence of a low S-velocity layer between 3 and 4 km depth.

In this way, we obtain the first Moho depth and Vp/Vs maps of Ireland based on a uniform distribution of measurements. The results are used to examine in detail the lateral variation of crustal thickness and Vp/Vs ratio across the major terrane boundaries in Ireland. Our results show a good agreement with the available previous estimates from onshore wide-angle/refraction experiments and add new information in poorly constrained areas such as Northern Ireland and the NW coast of Ireland. The mean Vp/Vs ratio is 1.73 \{\{\}+/-\{\}\} 0.05 with a consistently low (\{\{\}approx\{\}\}1.70) value in the Leinster domain and in central Ireland. The mean crustal thickness is 30.9 \{\{\}+/-\{\}\} 2.3 km. The southern portion of the island shows a nearly flat Moho at a depth of 32-33 km, while north of the Southern Uplands Fault, a relatively higher spatial frequency variation in Moho topography exists with values ranging from 28 to 32 km. This reflects the complex history of multiphase terranes accretion during the Caledonian orogeny, although locally, the superposition of more recent geological processes is not excluded. Crossing the Iapetus Suture Zone, our results support the presence of a transitional' Moho, that is, a 3-4 km smooth seismic transition between crust and mantle, while Moho depth remains constant. Anomalous values in Northern Ireland are interpreted as evidence of a 5- to 6-km-thick high S-wave velocity layer just above the Moho.},

Mineralisation is centred on thin, pipe-like Late Ordovician to Early Silurian quartz monzonite porphyry complexes. Nine intrusive phases have been recognised, with a common sequence of emplacement recognised in all deposits. Pre-mineralisation intrusions include coarsegrained, equigranular monzodiorite and equigranular to weakly porphyritic biotite -- quartz monzonite (U -- Pb SHRIMP age 444.2 + 4.7 Ma). Three variably felsic quartz monzonite porphyry phases comprise the mineralised intrusive complexes: (i) volumetrically minor early and late mineralisation biotite-phyric quartz monzonite porphyry dykes; (ii) abundant synmineralisation K-feldspar-phyric quartz monzonite porphyry intrusions; and (iii) less abundant syn- to late mineralisation augite -- biotite K-feldspar-phyric quartz monzonite porphyry intrusions. Post-mineralisation basaltic trachyandesite dykes and augitephyric monzonite porphyry dykes are also present (U -- Pb SHRIMP age 436.7 + 3.3 Ma), as are younger mafic dykes. The regional volcanic and intrusive rocks define systematic geochemical trends consistent with high-temperature magmatic fractionation of basaltic trachyandesite through trachyte. However, the trace-element compositions and REE patterns of the mineralising intrusions cannot be explained by crystal fractionation alone because there is a return to more mafic compositions in the waning stages of intrusive activity. The intrusive complexes are interpreted to have formed due to the emplacement of mafic alkaline melts into the base of a crystallising, zoned, monzodiorite to monzonite magma chamber. Shallow crustal fault ruptures above the magma chamber probably caused instantaneous depressurisation and simultaneous egress of quartz monzonite porphyry and exsolved aqueous fluid into dilatant zones. Localised fracturing and additional volatile exsolution from the quartz monzonite melt is thought to have led to the formation of the quartz monzonite porphyry complexes and associated Cu --Au-bearing stockwork veins and related orthoclase alteration. Volatile-rich aqueous fluid partitioned LREE preferentially to MREE and HREE resulting in the development of distinctive U-shaped REE patterns of the ore-related intrusions.},

Depths to the Curie isotherms are further estimated from radially averaged amplitude spectra of magnetic data reduced to the pole. Data reductions effectively enhance boundaries of regional tectonic belts, such as the Dabie ultra-high metamorphic belt, the Tanlu Fault, and the Diaoyudao Uplift. Curie depths are estimated at between 19.6 and 48.9 km, with a mean of 31.7 km. The Subei Basin and the south Yellow Sea Basin in the lower Yangtze block show relatively deep Curie isotherms, up to about 35 km in depth, whereas in the surrounding areas Curie depths are aver-aged at about 25 km. This implies that the lower Yangtze Block has experienced a unique tectonic evolution and/or has unique basement lithology and structures. From a regional perspective, sedi-mentary basins, such as the Subei Basin, the south Yellow Sea Basin, and the East China Sea Basin, normally show deeper Curie isotherms than surrounding uplifts such as the Diaoyudao Uplift and the Zhemin Uplifts.

While isotopic signatures of eclogitic diamonds and their inclusions suggest deep recycling of crustal material, the crustal carbon source remains controversial; seafloor sediment -- the widely favored crustal carbon source -- cannot explain the combined carbon and nitrogen isotopic characteristics of eclogitic diamonds. Here we examined the carbon and oxygen isotopic signatures of bulk-rock carbonate for 80 geographically diverse samples from altered mafic-ultramafic oceanic crust (AOC), which comprises 95 vol\% of the crustal material in subducting slabs. The results show: (i) AOC contains carbonate with {$\delta$}13C values as low as -24‚Ä∞, indicating the presence of biogenic carbonate; (ii) carbonate in AOC was mainly formed during low-temperature ({\textbackslash}textless100 {$^\circ$}C) alteration processes. Modeling accounting for this newly recognized carbon source in the oceanic crust with formation temperatures {\textbackslash}textless100 {$^\circ$}C yields a global carbon influx of 1.5{\textpm}0.3 {\texttimes} 1012 mol C/yr carried by subducting AOC into the trench, which is 50--90\% of previous estimates, but still of the same order of the carbon influx carried by subducting sediments into the trench. The AOC can retain carbon better than sediment during subduction into the asthenosphere, transition zone and lower mantle. Mixing of asthenospheric and AOC fluids provides the first consistent explanation of the diverse record of carbon and nitrogen isotopes in diamonds, suggesting that AOC, instead of sediment, is the key carrier of crustal carbon into the deep mantle.},

Thus, they learn an entire family of PDEs, in contrast to classical methods which solve one instance of the equation. In this work, we formulate a new neural operator by parameterizing the integral kernel directly in Fourier space, allowing for an expressive and efficient architecture. We perform experiments on Burgers' equation, Darcy flow, and the Navier-Stokes equation (including the turbulent regime). Our Fourier neural operator shows state-of-the-art performance compared to existing neural network methodologies and it is up to three orders of magnitude faster compared to traditional PDE solvers.},

  abstract = {The time-variable features of interseismic deformation in subduction zones are poorly understood and commonly ignored. Here, by incorporating century-long leveling data and contemporary global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) velocities, we investigate the temporal evolution of interseismic deformation in southwest Japan using two-dimensional viscoelastic earthquake-cycle models. We find that a steady-state continental mantle viscosity of 1019 Pa{$\cdot$}s is required to explain these two geodetic data sets. Our preferred model predicts significant variations in the surface velocity field throughout the entire interseismic period due to viscous mantle flow driven by ongoing megathrust locking, indicating that the multiyear GNSS-derived velocity field represents a snapshot of time-varying interseismic deformation. The locking depth and locking time exert significant influences on the horizontal and vertical deformation patterns. Our findings highlight the importance of the interseismically relaxing mantle and the necessity of considering such an effect in determining the current locking state along the Nankai subduction zone. Plain Language Summary Interseismic viscoelastic relaxation due to megathrust fault locking is explored recently using a viscoelastic Earth model for the late-stage interseismic period in the Cascadia and Peru-North Chile subduction zones, where the last great earthquake occurred centuries ago, and the next event is expected in the near future. In southwest Japan, the last great earthquake occurred only several decades ago, providing a unique opportunity to study the viscoelastic relaxation in early-stage interseismic period. We use historical measurements of uplift rates that were acquired before and after the last great earthquake and modern geodetic measurements of the horizontal and vertical surface velocities to constrain our numerical models and investigate how and why the surface deformation varies throughout the long interseismic period. We find that the horizontal and vertical velocity field gradually evolves into a long-wavelength pattern and a rather flat pattern, respectively, before the next event, which is consistent with both the historical and recent observations. Therefore, the recent and short time geodetic measurements in southwest Japan represent a snapshot of the time-variable signal because the weak Earth mantle is flowing viscously, driven by persistent megathrust fault locking, and the flow has not achieved a steady state.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we use a robust inversion algorithm, which we have tested in many regional studies, to obtain the first global model of Curie-point depth (GCDM) from magnetic anomaly inversion based on fractal magnetization. Statistically, the oceanic Curie depth mean is smaller than the continental one, but continental Curie depths are almost bimodal, showing shallow Curie points in some old cratons. Oceanic Curie depths show modifications by hydrothermal circulations in young oceanic lithosphere and thermal perturbations in old oceanic lithosphere. Oceanic Curie depths also show strong dependence on the spreading rate along active spreading centers. Curie depths and heat flow are correlated, following optimal theoretical curves of average thermal conductivities K = {$\sim$}2.0 W(m{$^\circ$}C) -1 for the ocean and K = {$\sim$}2.5 W(m{$^\circ$}C) -1 for the continent. The calculated heat flow from Curie depths and large-interval gridding of measured heat flow all indicate that the global heat flow average is about 70.0 mW/m 2 , leading to a global heat loss ranging from {$\sim$}34.6 to 36.6 TW. Our planet Earth is under constant cooling and differentiation since its origin. Its current thermal state and heat loss can be estimated from surface heat flow measurements 1--6 . However, heat flow estimates have evident drawbacks; they are often measured at sparsely and irregularly distributed sites, and they are strongly affected by shallow hydrothermal circulation and therefore are limited in inferring deep thermal structure of the lith-osphere. These uncertainties put quite different estimates of global heat loss. In one early study 1 , and in some recent calibrations minimizing the hydrothermal effects 3,4 , the global heat loss was estimated at about 40--47 TW (or 4.4--4.7 {\texttimes} 10 13 W). Other reappraisals of global heat flow database, however, concluded that global conductive heat loss falls in the range from 29 to 34 TW 2,5,6 . The differences between these estimates vary considerably. An alternate and independent method of studying deep thermal structure and global heat loss is by detecting Curie depths from inversion of surface total field magnetic anomalies 7--14 . Global coverage of magnetic anomalies is being constantly improved in recent years 15,16 , and this allows it possible to map the global Curie isotherm in high-resolution, assuming that the Curie-point temperature is constant globally around 550 {$^\circ$}C 17,18 and that lateral compositional variations exert neglectable influence on the Curie temperature. There are several different technical schemes of Curie depth inversion from magnetic anomalies, and even for the same method the selected inversion parameters can also vary among scientists 7--14 . Furthermore, previous studies focus only on a particular region of the Earth. These facts render it impossible the global comparison of Curie depth results. In early regional studies, we have successfully automated the centroid method based on radially-averaged amplitude spectrum to obtain high-resolution Curie depths 9--11 . This saves considerably the computational time. Now we can naturally apply this algorithm to the Earth Magnetic Anomaly Grid of 2-arc-minute resolution (EMAG2, http://geomag.org/) 16 to obtain the first global reference model of Curie-point depths (GCDM). Implementation of the Algorithm The Earth's surface from - 75{$^\circ$} to 75{$^\circ$} latitudes is divided into 72 zones, and the two polar zones are treated sepa-rately. Within each zone, we transform the magnetic data from geographical coordinate to Cartesian coordinate, before gridding the data in a constant 2.6 km interval using the minimum curvature method, which iteratively solves a set of differential equations to minimize the total second horizontal derivative and honor input data 19},

  abstract = {I investigate large-scale deep crustal structures of the Nankai subduction zone and neighboring region using regional magnetic and gravity anomalies, heat flow measurements, and earthquake hypocenters. It is found that ages, dip angles, and geothermal states of the subducting slab have direct influences on mantle wedge serpentinization. The weakest serpentinization observed in the Nankai forearc region is associated with the youngest downgoing plate of the Shikoku Basin. Conspicuous gravity anomalies identified in the forearc region are coincidental spatially with magnetic anomalies after the reduction to the pole, a mathematical procedure that helps relocate magnetic sources and boundaries, and allows us to more easily interpret magnetic data. It is argued that these patches of magnetic and gravity anomalies are caused by the same sources of anomalous density and magnetization, and are linked directly to preexisting structures such as magnetic anomalies and their boundaries in the subducting oceanic crust. Since the gravity and magnetic anomaly patches are found to be closely related to interplate seismogenic behaviors in the Nankai subduction zone, I suggest that major magnetic boundaries in the Shikoku Basin are likely weak places for slab tears that trigger seismic segmentations along the subduction zone. Application of the Parker-Oldenburg algorithm to Bouguer gravity anomalies yields a 3D Moho topography. Curie-point depths are also estimated from the magnetic anomalies with reduction to the pole using a windowed wavenumber-domain algorithm. Window sizes are found to have little effects on the average Curie-point depths other than lowering lateral resolutions. A wide zone of deep Curie depths is identified in southwest Japan, relating to strong influence from the subduction of the relatively young and warm Shikoku Basin crust of the Philippine Sea plate. Curie depths so obtained can be correlated well with heat flow measurements, which cluster around a theoretical curve when the average thermal conductivity is about 3.0. W/(m. {$^\circ$}C). Using constraints from both Curie depths and heat flow, I also model the shallow geothermal field of the subduction zone. Earthquake hypocenters plotted against Moho and Curie depths and geothermal fields on three transects confirm early studies that downdip limits of seismogenic zones along the Nankai plate boundary do not extend down to the island arc Moho and their temperatures are more or less close to 350. {$^\circ$}C. Geothermal field has direct influences on earthquake distributions in the overriding island arc and accretionary prism, within the subducting oceanic lithosphere, and along the interplate boundary. {\copyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Geological three-dimensional (3D) models are constructed to reliably represent a given geological target. The reliability of a model is heavily dependent on the input data and is sensitive to uncertainty. This study examines the uncertainty introduced by geological orientation data by producing a suite of implicit 3d models generated from orientation measurements subjected to uncertainty simulations. The resulting uncertainty associated with different regions of the geological model can be located, quantified and visualised, providing a useful method to assess model reliability. The method is tested on a natural geological setting in the Gippsland Basin, southeastern Australia, where modelled geological surfaces are assessed for uncertainty. The concept of stratigraphic variability is introduced and analysis of the input data is performed using two uncertainty visualisation methods. Uncertainty visualisation through stratigraphic variability is designed to convey the complex concept of 3D model uncertainty to the geoscientist in an effective manner. Uncertainty analysis determined that additional seismic information provides an effective means of constraining modelled geology and reducing uncertainty in regions proximal to the seismic sections. Improvements to the reliability of high uncertainty regions achieved using information gathered from uncertainty visualisations are quantified in a comparative case study. Uncertainty in specific model locations is identified and attributed to possible disagreements between seismic and isopach data. Further improvements to and additional sources of data for the model are proposed based on this information. Finally, a method of introducing stratigraphic variability values as geological constraints for geophysical inversion is presented.},

  abstract = {The process of 3-D modelling forces the operator to consider data collection and processing error, while simultaneously making assumptions about geology during interpretation, to arrive at the most likely or logical geological scenario. These kinds of ambiguities lead to situations where multiple model realizations can be produced from a single input data set. Decisions are typically made during the modelling process with the aim of reducing the number of possible models, preferably to produce a single geological realization. These types of decisions involve how input data are processed and what data are included, and are always made without complete knowledge of the system under study. This regularly, if not always, results in natural geometries being misrepresented by the model, which can be attributed to uncertainty inherent in the modelling process. Uncertainty is unavoidable in geological modelling as complete knowledge of the natural system is impossible, though we use many techniques to reduce the amount introduced during the modelling process. A common technique used to reduce uncertainty is geophysical forward modelling, and the misfit between the calculated and observed response provides a means to gauge whether changes in model architecture improve or degrade the quality of the model. Unfortunately, geophysical data are ambiguous and provide a non-unique solution, with different model geometries able to produce the same geophysical response.We propose a process whereby multiple models, collectively known as the `model suite', are produced from a single data set that allows an exploration of geological model space. Various `geodiversity' metrics have been developed to characterize geometrical and geophysical aspects of each model. Geodiversity measurements are combined into multivariate analysis to reveal relationships between metrics and define the boundaries of the geological possibility. A previous study using geodiversity metrics on the Gippsland Basin is extended here by including geophysical metrics. We use the Ashanti Greenstone Belt, southwestern Ghana in West Africa, as a case study to assess the usefulness of the technique. A critical assessment of the 3-D model is performed and aspects of the model space are identified that could be of interest to gold explorers.},

  abstract = {In the last 1000 million years, Australia has been part of two supercontinents: Palaeozoic Gondwanaland and Neoproterozoic Rodinia. Neoproterozoic Australia was covered by shallow epicontinental seas, and, in the late Neoproterozoic, by low-latitude glaciers. The breakup of Rodinia along the Tasman Line occurred at the end of the Sturtian glaciation (760 Ma) giving rise to the Palaeo-Pacific Ocean. Gondwanaland formed in the Early Cambrian, at the same time as the Tarim block broke away from northwestern Australia. Westward subduction of the Palaeo-Pacific Ocean along the eastern margin of Australia-Antarctica commenced during the Early Cambrian in northern Victoria Land and in the Middle Cambrian in South Australia, and culminated to the Late Cambrian-Early Ordovician Ross-Delamerian Mountains. In the Ordovician, the magmatic arc retreated from Australia's then-eastern continental margin, forming a marginal sea and offshore island arc. A shallow seaway across Australia in the Late Cambrian and Ordovician gradually gave way to desert-like conditions in Central Australia and the adjacent Canning Basin by Silurian time. The Silurian to mid-Devonian was an interval of rapidly changing palaeogeography in eastern Australia with deep volcanogenic troughs formed in a dextral transtensional tectonic setting. Widespread deformation in the Tasman orogenic zone in the Middle Devonian to Early Carboniferous, was accompanied by the development of an Andean-style magmatic arc along the Pacific continental margin of Australia. The most widespread Phanerozoic mountain-building stage in Central Australia occurred in the Late Devonian to mid-Carboniferous, as part of a world-wide Variscan orogenic episode associated with the collision of Gondwanaland with Laurussia to form Pangea. In the late Visean, Australia drifted rapidly southward from previous low latitudes to a near-polar position. Glacial conditions dominated the Late Carboniferous and earliest Permian. Transtensional basins associated with dextral oroclinal shear along the Panthalassan eastern margin of Australia developed in the Late Carboniferous and persisted until the Late Permian, when an Andean-style magmatic arc was re-established. Large foreland basins inboard of the Late Permian to Early Triassic magmatic arc accumulated major coal deposits during Late Permian volcanic phases, but drastic climatic changes at the end of the Permian, possibly caused by global greenhouse conditions, led to red-bed deposition in the Early Triassic. Pangea began to rift in the mid-Triassic, and by the Late Triassic, the Cimmerian blocks, which lay off northwestern Australia throughout the Palaeozoic, had departed the northern margin of Gondwanaland. A new Andean-style continental magmatic arc became established along the Pacific Ocean margin of Australia. Breakup between Australia-Antarctica and the northern part of Greater India commenced ca. 130 Ma, and between Ausralia and Antarctica around 96 Ma. At the beginning of the Palaeogene, Australia commenced its northward drift towards its present position. Seafloor spreading between Australia and Antarctica was at first slow, but increased to ca. t cm per year around 45 Ma. By 35 Ma, the circum-Antarctic current became established, thereby triggering glaciation in Antarctica. Northern Australia reached the tropics by the beginning of the Miocene, and Australia has progressively moved northwards at 7 to 8 cm per year since. {\copyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

As a result an essential reduction of the required number of nodal points may usually be achieved. Thus the FDM can be competitive in some fields to the finite element method. Several troubles arising from the use of an irregulr mesh have been solved, the most important being elimination of singular or ill-conditioned stars, and a successful way of automatic discretization of boundary conditions was proposed. As a result of this complete automatization of the FDM has been reached. Many problems connected with the theory of the method proposed and its computer implementation have been discussed. FIDAM code-a system of computer programs designed for the solution of two-dimensional, linear and nonlinear, elliptic problems and three-dimensional parabolic problems is presented. Problems to be solved should be layed down in a local formulation as a set of partial derivative equations of the second order with boundary conditions not exceeding the same order. Various particular problems of applied mechanics and physics such as: torsion of bars, plane elasticity problems, deflections of plates and membranes, fluid now and temperature distribution have been solved using the FIDAM procedures. For the solution of nonlinear problems various iterative methods have been adopted-with special attention payed to the self-correcting method where the Newton-Raphson and incremental procedures are particular cases. The present version of the method allows fully automatic calculations to be carried out as in advanced programs of the finite element method and may be preferred in non-linear, optimization and time-dependent problems. ?? 1980.},

Two theoretical models of radial amplitude spectrum of magnetic anomalies are found almost identical, and both are applicable to detecting Curie depths in using the centroid method based on spectral linearization at certain wave number bands. Theoretical and numerical studies confirm the robustness of this inversion scheme. A fractal exponent of 3.0 in the magnetic susceptibility is found suitable, and Curie depths are well constrained by their known depths near the mid-Atlantic ridge. While generally increasing with growing ages, North Atlantic Curie depths show large oscillating and heterogeneous patterns related most likely to small-scale sublithospheric convections, which are found to have an onset time around 40 Ma and a scale of about 500 km, and are in preferred transverse rolls. Hotspots in North Atlantic also contribute to large geothermal and Curie-depth variations, but they appear to connect more closely to geochemical anomalies or small-scale convection than to mantle plumes. Curie depths can be correlated to heat flow gridded in a constant 1{$^\circ$} interval, which reveals decreasing effective thermal conductivity with depths within the magnetic layer. North Atlantic Curie points are mostly beneath the Moho, suggesting that the uppermost mantle is magnetized from serpentinization and induces long-wavelength magnetic anomalies. Small-scale convection and serpentinization together may cause apparent flattening and deviations in heat flow and bathymetry from theoretical cooling models in old oceanic lithosphere.},

  abstract = {We quantify the bulk topographic characteristics of the Tibet-Qinghai plateau with specific focus on three representative regions: northern, central, and southeastern Tibet. Quantitative landscape information is extracted from Shuttle Radar Topography Mission digital elevation models. We find that the morphology of the Tibetan plateau is nonuniform with systematic regional differences. The northern and central parts of the plateau are characterized by what we suggest to call ``positive topography,'' i.e., a topography in which elevation is positively correlated with relief and mean slope. A major change from the internally drained central part of Tibet to the externally drained part of eastern Tibet is accompanied by a transition from low to high relief and from positive to ``negative topography,'' i.e., a topography where there is an inverse or negative correlation between elevation and relief and between elevation and mean slope. Relief in eastern Tibet is largest along rivers as they cross an ancient, eroded plateau margin at high angle to the major strike-slip faults, the Yalong-Yulong thrust belt, implying strong structural control of regional topography. We propose that the evolution of river systems and drainage efficiency, the ability of rivers to transport sediments out of the orogen, coupled with tectonic uplift, is the simplest mechanism to explain systematic regional differences in Tibetan landscapes. Basin filling due to inefficient drainage played a major role in smoothing out the tectonically generated structural relief. This mode of smoothing started concurrently with tectonic construction of the relief, as most clearly illustrated today in the Qilian Shan-Qaidam region of the northeastern plateau. In the interior of Tibet, further ``passive'' filling, due to internal drainage only, continued to smooth the local relief millions of years after the cessation of major phases of surface uplift due to crustal shortening. Thus, diachronous beveling at high elevation produced the low-relief surface of the high plateau. In southeast Tibet, headward retreat of external drainages brought back ``in'' the global ocean base level, first disrupting then interrupting the relief-reduction process. It produced a transitional topography by dissecting the ``old'' remnant plateau surface, which introduced younger and steeper incision of this hitherto preserved high base level. This provides a unifying mechanism for the formation of the low-relief plateau interior, and for the origin of the high-elevation, low-relief relict surface in southeastern Tibet. Our analysis brings forth the importance of surface processes, in particular drainage efficiency, in shaping plateau morphology and landscape relief. Such key processes appear to have been mostly ignored in numerical models of plateau deformation. Our results also cast doubt on and provide a more realistic alternative to the fashionable contention that a continuous preuplift, low-relief surface first formed at low elevation, extending all the way to the South China Sea shore, before being warped upward in the late Miocene-Pliocene by lower crustal channel flow.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The occurrence of natural hydrogen and its sources have been reviewed extensively in the literature over the last few years, with current research across both academia and industry focused on assessing the feasibility of utilizing natural hydrogen as an energy resource. However, gaps remain in our understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the large-scale transport of hydrogen and migration through the deep and shallow Earth and within geological basins. Due to the unique chemical and physical properties of hydrogen, the timescales of migration within different areas of Earth vary from billions to thousands of years. Within the shallow Earth, diffusive and advective transport mechanisms are dependent on a wide range of parameters including geological structure, microbial activity, and subsurface environmental factors. Hydrogen migration through different media may occur from geological timescales to days and hours. We review the nature and timescale of hydrogen migration from the planetary to basin-scale, and within both the deep and shallow Earth. We explore the role of planetary accretion in setting the hydrogen budget of the lower mantle, discuss conceptual frameworks for primordial or deep mantle hydrogen migration to the Earth's surface and evaluate the literature on the lower mantle's potential role in setting the hydrogen budget of rocks delivered from the deep Earth. We also review the mechanisms and timescales of hydrogen within diffusive and advective, fossil versus generative and within biologically moderated systems within the shallow Earth. Finally, we summarize timescales of hydrogen migration through different regions within sedimentary basins.           ,              Plain Language Summary             Over the last several years, naturally-occurring hydrogen has emerged as a potential game changer in the energy transition. However, the vast majority of current research focuses on understanding hydrogen generation and underground storage. Important questions remain---how did hydrogen come to be within Earth? What are the timescales of hydrogen movement through different regions of Earth and within different rock types? In this review, we describe the processes responsible for entraining hydrogen into Earth's mantle during the time of planetary formation and timescale of evolution toward the present-day hydrogen cycle. We summarize the importance of environmental factors and mineralogy for hydrogen movement and the timescale of generative and destructive processes in the shallow Earth. Finally, we summarize the timescale of hydrogen movement within different regions of Earth from the planetary to basin-scale and within different minerals and rock types.           ,              Key Points                                                                History of planetary formation and overview of natural hydrogen cycle of Earth                                                     Summary of mechanisms for hydrogen migration (diffusion and advection), generation and consumption by microbial reactions                                                     Summary of indicative timescales of hydrogen migration within crystalline and sedimentary rocks},

Fifty-nine recording stations were deployed along this profile and it was served by a total of six shotpoints. The profile crosses the predominant NE-SW (Caledonian) strike at a steep angle. Using both one-dimensional and two-dimensional seismic inversion techniques, a travel-time and relative amplitude study of the observed P-wave data was undertaken. Gravity data along the profile was modelled to test the plausability of the derived velocity-depth section. The upper crustal structure along the profile is highly variable but some features stand out. A large, low-velocity body towards the south of the traverse correlates well with a Bouguer anomaly low and is interpreted as the southwest extension of the buried Leinster batholith. The mid-crust is approximately 10 km thick and is bound at its top and bottom by two laterally continuous reflecting horizons. Both reflectors shallow northwards by about 5 km over a horizontal distance of some 60 km. This northwards shallowing is a feature also displayed by a number of isolines in the upper crust and it marks a broad region of crustal change along the traverse in the zone of proposed Caledonian suturing. Crustal thickness beneath COOLE I is approximately 30 km and the Moho is a transition zone about 2 km thick which shallows slightly towards the coasts. {\copyright} 1989.},

An approximate system of linear equations arising from the Newton linearization is solved by the GMRES (generalized minimum residual) algorithm with a LU-SGS (lower--upper symmetric Gauss--Seidel) preconditioner. A remarkable feature of the present GMRES+LU-SGS method is that the storage of the Jacobian matrix can be completely eliminated by approximating the Jacobian with numerical fluxes, resulting in a matrix-free implicit method. The method developed has been used to compute the compressible flows around 3D complex aerodynamic configurations for a wide range of flow conditions, from subsonic to supersonic. The numerical results obtained indicate that the use of the GMRES+LU-SGS method leads to a significant increase in performance over the best current implicit methods, GMRES+ILU and LU-SGS, while maintaining memory requirements similar to its explicit counterpart. An overall speedup factor from eight to more than one order of magnitude for all test cases in comparison with the explicit method is demonstrated.}

  abstract = {The Earth's lithosphere can focus basaltic magmatism along pre-existing weakness zones or discontinuities. However, apart from the influence on the geochemistry of magmas emplaced in subduction tectonic settings (mantle wedge metasomatism related to dehydration of the subducting plates) the role of lithosphere as a magma source for intra-plate (both oceanic and continental), continental margin, and mid-ocean ridge magmatism is not yet fully understood. In many cases intra-plate magmatism has been explained with the existence of deep thermal anomalies (mantle plumes) whose origin has been placed near the upper-lower mantle transition zone (660 km discontinuity) or even deeper, near the mantle-core boundary ( approximately 2900 km). Also in many continental flood basalt provinces (mostly initiated at craton margins) an active role for mantle plumes has been invoked to explain the high melt productivity. In these cases, no active role for melt production has been attributed to the lithospheric mantle. Potential contaminations of asthenospheric or even deeper mantle melts are often considered the only influence of the lithosphere (both crust and mantle) in basalt petrogenesis. In other cases, an active role of the lithospheric mantle has been proposed: the thermal anomalies related to the presence of mantle plumes would trigger partial melting in the lithospheric mantle. At present there is no unequivocal geochemical tracer that reflects the relative role of lithosphere and upper/lower mantle as magma sources. In this paper another role of the lithosphere is proposed. The new model presented here is based on the role of lower crustal and lithospheric mantle recycling by delamination and detachment. This process can explain at least some geochemical peculiarities of basaltic rocks found in large and small volume igneous provinces, as well as in mid-ocean ridge basalts. Metamorphic reactions occurring in the lower continental crust as a consequence of continent-continent can lead to a density increase (up to 3.8 g/cm (super 3) ) with the appearance of garnet in the metamorphic assemblage (basalt-{\textbackslash}textgreateramphibolite-{\textbackslash}textgreatergarnet clinopyroxenite/eclogite) leading to gravitative instability of the overthickened lithospheric keel (lower crust+lithospheric mantle). This may detach from the uppermost lithosphere and sink into the upper mantle. Accordingly, metasomatic reactions between SiO (sub 2) -rich lower crust partial melts and the uprising asthenospheric mantle (replacing the volume formerly occupied by the sunken lithospheric mantle and the lower crust) lead to formation of orthopyroxene-rich layers with strong crustal signatures. Such metasomatized mantle volumes may remain untapped also for several Ma before being reactivated by geological processes. Partial melts of such sources would bear strong lower crustal signatures giving rise to Enriched Mantle type 1 (EMI)-like basaltic magmatism. Basaltic magmatism with such a geochemical signature is relatively scarce but in some cases (e.g., Indian Ocean) it can be a geographically widespread and long-lasting phenomenon. spread and long-lasting phenomenon.},

Here we use palaeo-digital elevation models (palaeoDEMs; based on high-resolution palaeogeographic reconstructions), HadCM3L general circulation model (GCM) climate data and the BQART suspended sediment discharge model to demonstrate a predictive, forward approach to palaeo-sediment routing system analysis. To exemplify our approach, we use palaeoDEMs and HadCM3L data to predict the configurations, geometries and climates of large continental catchments in the Cenomanian and Turonian North American continent. Then, we use BQART to estimate suspended sediment discharges and catchment-averaged erosion rates and we map their spatial distributions. We validate our estimates with published geologic constraints from the Cenomanian Dunvegan Formation, Alberta, Canada, and the Turonian Ferron Sandstone, Utah, USA, and find that estimates are consistent or within a factor of two to three. We then evaluate the univariate and multivariate sensitivity of our estimates to a range of uncertainty margins on palaeogeographic and palaeoclimatic boundary conditions; large uncertainty margins ({$\leq$}50\%/{\textpm}5{$^\circ$}C) still recover estimates of suspended sediment discharge within an order of magnitude of published constraints. PalaeoDEMs are therefore suitable as a first-order investigative tool in palaeo-sediment routing system analysis and are particularly useful where stratigraphic records are incomplete. We highlight the potential of this approach to predict the global spatio-temporal response of suspended sediment discharges and catchment-averaged erosion rates to long-period tectonic and climatic forcing in the geologic past.{\textbackslash}textless/p{\textbackslash}textgreater},

  abstract = {We present a new statistical method to construct a model for the chemical composition of Earth's primitive mantle along with its variance. Earth's primitive mantle is located on the melting trend exhibited by the global compilation of mantle peridotites, using cosmochemical constraints on the relative abundances of refractory lithophile elements (RLE). This so-called pyrolite approach involves the least amount of assumptions, thereby being probably most satisfactory compared to other approaches. Its previous implementations, however, suffer from questionable statistical treatment of noisy geochemical data, leaving the uncertainty of model composition poorly quantified. In order to properly take into account how scatters in peridotite data affect this geochemical inference, we combine the following statistical techniques: (1) modeling a nonlinear melting trend in the multidimensional compositional space through the principal component analysis, (2) determining the primitive mantle composition on the melting trend by simultaneously imposing all of cosmochemical constraints with least squares, and (3) mapping scatters in original data into the variance of the final model through the bootstrap resampling technique. Whereas our model is similar to previous models in terms of Mg, Si, and Fe abundances, the RLE contents are at {$\sim$}2.16 {\textpm} 0.37 times the CI chondrite concentration, which is lower than most of previous estimates. The new model is depleted by {\textbackslash}textgreater20\% in a number of incompatible elements including heat-producing elements, U, Th, and K, and this depleted nature is further amplified (up to 60\%) in terms of predicted composition for the present-day mantle.}

During continental rifting, normal faults modify the geometry of igneous networks by providing preferential pathways for the intrusion of magma. However, the way in which magma intrudes into fault planes is poorly understood. Here, we quantitatively document the relationship between fault architecture and intrusion distribution and geometry using three-dimensional seismic refl ection data from the Exmouth Sub-basin, offshore northwest Australia. Inclined segments of saucer-shaped sills intrude several faults along convex-into-the-hang- ingwall fault-plane corrugations. We suggest that stress fi eld perturbations associated with the fault-plane corrugations provide suitable conditions for fault reactivation as magma conduits. Pre-existing faults also modify sill geometries through the offset of stratigraphic horizons that may be preferentially intruded, potentially resulting in the formation of a new sill or the development of minor intrusive steps. This work emphasizes the importance of the pre-existing structural template in controlling the growth and final geometry of intrusive networks}

Variations in T-s correlate with variations in the effective elastic thickness (T-e), both of them having similar values, although T-e is usually the smaller of the two. These observations suggest that the lower crust, at. least in some places, is stronger than the mantle beneath the Moho, contrary to most models of continental rheology. Thus the strength of the continental lithosphere is likely to be contained within the seismogenic layer, variations in the thickness of this strong layer determining the heights of the mountain ranges it can support. The aseismic nature of the continental mantle and the lower crustal seismicity beneath some shields are probably related to their water contents.},

This first comprehensive analysis of these data has produced a sub-horizontally layered seismic and associated gravity model that correlates well with surface geology. A north-south decrease in crustal velocity and density corresponds to the change from Avalonian crust into the Rheno-Hercynian zone at the south end of the profile. High velocities and densities in the lowest crustal layer beneath north Wales are proposed to result from Cenozoic and possibly Ordovician igneous intrusive rocks, the former derived from an upwelling plume associated with the opening of the North Atlantic. Examination of the load distribution throughout the model shows that it is strongly correlated with the earthquake distribution along LISPB DELTA. Earthquake focal depth also correlates with heat flow. A simple heat-flow profile has been derived, and the seismic velocity model used to constrain crustal heat production values. A long-wavelength excursion from published data can be explained in terms of an increase in mantle heat flow resulting from a previously identified deep thermal anomaly beneath the Irish Sea.},

The relationship between temperature and electrical conductivity in the crust is investigated by means of results from 251 heat flow determinations and 301 magnetotelluric (MT) soundings. We first compared maps of MT phase at period 10 s and of heat flow. Larger phases correlate with higher heat flows in some areas, but the relationship is complicated by other causes of variation in these two parameters. To give a more focussed comparison, we map the depth d450 to the 450{$^\circ$}C isotherm for two assumed distributions of reduced heat flow, and the depth d c to the top of the lower crustal conductor at MT sites away from major fracture zones. The map of d c visually resembles both of the maps of d450, and readings at 76 points of a grid give correlation coefficient 0.80. This supports a relationship between high conductivity in the crust and temperatures above 450{$^\circ$}C. Both the lower crustal conductor and the 450{$^\circ$}C isotherm occur at depths near 30 km above the subducting oceanic plate under Vancouver Island, at 15-20 km in the Intermontane Belt, and of 10-15 km in the Omineca Belt. If there is an upcurrent in the mantle beneath the continent, behind the subduction, as proposed elsewhere, its axis may now be under the Omineca belt. This location is in harmony with evidence of recent extension and uplift there. 1.}

Maps presented show large temperature variability, related mainly to heat flow patterns. The highest temperatures occur in western and northern Canada. Here temperatures greater than 150 {$^\circ$}C, required for enhanced geothermal systems (EGS), can be reached at reasonable drilling depths of {\textbackslash}textless5 km. Heat flow, by itself however, is not a sufficient tool to predict areas of high energy content. A combination of thick low thermal conductivity sedimentary blankets and moderate to high heat flow areas can generate targets that are as favorable as regions with high conductivity and high heat flow. Some moderate heat flow areas in the deeper parts of the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin have heat content comparable to high heat flow zones of the the Canadian Cordillera. The magnitude of in-place thermal energy available for future heat 'mining/farming' was esitmated throughout Canada by calculating heat released through cooling a defined rock volume through a fixed temperature change. These estimates show the first-order appoximation of available geothermal heat content. The fraction of true heat energy available will be as low as 0.02 of these values.

New heat flow map of Europe is based on updated database of uncorrected heat flow values to which paleoclimatic correction is applied across the continent. Correction is depth dependent due to a diffusive thermal transfer of the surface temperature forcing of which glacial--interglacial history has the largest impact. It is obvious that large part of the uncorrected heat flow values in the existing heat flow databases from wells as shallow as few hundreds of meters is underestimated. This explains some very low uncorrected heat flow values 20--30 mW/m2 in the shields and shallow basin areas of the craton. Also, heat flow values in other areas including orogenic belts are likely underestimated. Based on the uncorrected and corrected heat flow maps using 5 km {\texttimes} 5 km grid, we have calculated average heat flow values (uncorrected heat flow: 56.0 mW/m2; SD 20.3 mW/m2 vs. corrected heat flow: 63.2 mW/m2; SD 19.6 m/Wm2) and heat loss for the continental part.

Average heat conductivity for various geological formations has been estimated on the basis of net rock studies by Canadian Stratigraphie Services. These data and observations of temperature made in ``shut-in holes'' in some of the oil pools have been used in heat flow estimations by the Bullard method. The geothermal gradient and heat flow within the basin are exceptionally high in comparison with the other world wide Precambrian platform areas. Especially high geothermal gradient areas are found in the northwestern part of the Prairies Basin in Alberta and British Columbia and most of southeastern and southwestern Saskatchewan. Areas of low gradient are found mainly in the Disturbed Belt of the Foothills, southern and southeastern Alberta, and the Peace River area in British Columbia. Neither the analysis of regional heat conductivity distribution nor the heat generation distribution of the basement rock of the Prairies Basin evaluated on the basis of U, Th and K data after Burwash (1979), explain the observed heat flow patterns of the Prairies Basin. Comparison of heat flow patterns with some of the hydrogeological phenomena suggests the significant influence of fluid flow in the basin formations on geothermal features. Low geothermal gradient areas coincide with water recharge areas and high hydraulic head distribution regions. The phenomenon of upward water movement in the deep strata and downward flow through much of the Cenozoic and Mesozoic strata seems to control the regional heat flow distribution in the basin. The analyses of coal metamorphism in the upper and middle Mesozoic formations of the Foothills Belt and in the central Prairies Basin suggest that the pre-Laramide paleogeothermal heat flow distribution was different from the present one. It is very probable that the Foothills Belt area was characterized by a higher geothermal gradient than the central part of the Prairies Basin, i.e. opposite to the present picture.}

Geol. Soc. Am. 34 (1923) 703]. The borehole climate method is unique as it is based on the direct physical link between the measured temperature--depth profile and the reconstructed parameter of the past climate, the ground surface temperature (GST). It is unlike most of the other approximate methods of the past climate reconstruction. It has proved to be quite successful in reconstructing two robust signals: (a) the amplitude of the last glacial/interglacial temperature difference and (b) the surface temperature trend of the last 100--150 years and eventually, when combined with the surface air temperature series, in estimating their pre-observational means (POMs). A reconstruction of less robust signals of the little ice age, medieval climatic optimum, Boreal, Atlantic and possibly some other climatic periods of the Holocene fails even in most cases of purely conductive subsurface thermal regime. Borehole temperature profiles are not proxy for surface temperature, but a direct measure of the energy balance at the Earth's continental surface. The signal underground is, however, attenuated considerably through heat diffusion. The degradation of the signal imposes a physical limit on the information potentially retrieved from the observed subsurface temperature anomalies. We describe the basic features and problems of the method of reconstruction of GST history from the temperature--depth profiles measured in boreholes which is illustrated by Canadian and other continental examples.},

We first review the mechanisms responsible for mantle heat flow. We take the total global surface heat flow to be 4.43X10 (super 13) W. Of this, we attribute 0.68X10 (super 13) W (15\%) to radiogenic heat production in the continental crust and 3.75X10 (super 13) W (85\%) to heat loss from the mantle. Of the heat loss from the mantle, 2.17X10 (super 13) W (58\%) is attributed to the subduction of the oceanic lithosphere and the remainder, 1.58X10 (super 13) W (42\%), heats the base of the oceanic and continental lithosphere. Prior buoyancy studies of plumes give a plume heat flux of 0.24X10 (super 13) W, which is only 15\% of the total heat flux associated with basal heating of the lithosphere. Thus, the amount that remains unaccounted for is a basal heat flux of 1.34X10 (super 13) W. The missing heat flux can be attributed either to plumes that do not have a significant surface expression, or to secondary mantle convection beneath the plates. We show that the cumulative frequency-size distribution of the large and intermediate size plume fluxes can be reasonably well approximated by a power-law distribution. We then extrapolate this distribution to smaller plumes in order to estimate a total plume heat flux. This requires about 5200 plumes, with the smallest plume fluxes about 10 (super 9) W. This compares with 12X10 (super 9) W for the smallest plume fluxes previously reported in the literature. We suggest that the large number of seamounts represents surface evidence for small plumes, and conclude that it is reasonable to attribute the entire basal heat flux to plumes.},

  abstract = {A key element in the solution of a geophysical inverse problem is the quantification of non-uniqueness, that is, how much parameters of an inferred earth model can vary while fitting a set of measurements. A widely used approach is that of Bayesian inference, where Bayes' rule is used to determine the uncertainty of the earth model parameters a posteriori given the data. I describe here, a natural extension of Bayesian parameter estimation that accounts for the posterior probability of how complex an earth model is (specifically, how many layers it contains). This approach has a built-in parsimony criterion: among all earth models that fit the data, those with fewer parameters (fewer layers) have higher posterior probabilities.To implement this approach in practice, I use a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm applied to the nonlinear problem of inverting DC resistivity sounding data to infer characteristics of a 1-D earth model. The earth model is parametrized as a layered medium, where the number of layers and their resistivities and thicknesses are poorly known a priori. The algorithm obtains a sample of layered media from the posterior distribution; this sample measures non-uniqueness in terms of how many layers are effectively resolved by the data and of the range of layer thicknesses and resistivities consistent with the data.Because the complexity of the model is effectively determined by the data, the solution does not need to be regularized. This is a desirable feature, because requiring the solution to be smooth beyond what is implied by prior information can lead to underestimating posterior uncertainty. Letting the number of layers be a free parameter, as done here, broadens the space of earth models possible a priori and makes the determination of posterior uncertainty less dependent on the parametrization.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY             We propose that strain localization in plate interiors, such as linear belts of intraplate seismicity, may arise from spatial variations in viscous anisotropy produced by preferred orientation of olivine crystals (CPO or texture) inherited from previous deformation episodes in the lithospheric mantle. To quantify this effect, we model the deformation of a plate containing a fossil strike-slip mantle shear zone at different orientations relative to an imposed horizontal shortening, but no initial heterogeneity in the crust. The fossil shear zone is characterized by different orientation and intensity of the olivine CPO relatively to the surrounding mantle, which is isotropic in most simulations. The anisotropy in viscosity produced by the CPO, which remains fixed throughout the simulations, is described by an anisotropic (Hill) yield function parametrized based on second-order viscoplastic self-consistent (SO-VPSC) models. The results indicate that lateral variations in viscous anisotropy in the mantle affect the strain distribution in the entire lithosphere. Reactivation of the strike-slip mantle shear zone and strain localization in the crust above it occur for horizontal compression at 35--55{$^\circ$} to the fossil shear plane, with a maximum at 45{$^\circ$}. The magnitude of strain localization depends on (i) the contrast in viscous anisotropy and, hence, on the variations in CPO orientation and intensity in the mantle, (ii) the boundary conditions and (iii) the feedbacks between mantle and crustal deformation. For a strong olivine CPO, when the boundary conditions do not hinder shear parallel to the fossil mantle shear zone, strain rates within it are up to a factor 30 higher than in an isotropic surrounding mantle or up to a factor 200 when the surrounding mantle is anisotropic, which results in strain rates up to a factor 10 or up to a factor 100 higher in the crust right above the fossil shear zone. Frictional weakening in the crust faults increases strain localization in the entire lithospheric column. High strength contrasts between the mantle and the ductile crust result in less efficient mechanical coupling, with strong localization in the mantle and lower crust, but weak in the brittle upper crust. Decrease in the crust--mantle strength contrast enhances the coupling and produces more homogenous strain distribution with depth, as well as a time-dependent evolution of strain localization, which reaches a peak and decreases before attaining steady-state. Comparison of seismic anisotropy, regional stress and focal mechanism data in linear arrays of intraplate seismicity, like the New Madrid and South Armorican seismic zones, to our models' predictions corroborates that olivine CPO preserved in fossil lithospheric-scale shear zones may be key for the development of such structures.},

  abstract = {The linear structures of seismically fast anomalies, often interpreted as subducted slabs, in the southern Asia and circum-Pacific lower mantle provided strong evidence for the whole mantle convection model. However, recent seismic studies have consistently shown that subducted slabs are deflected horizontally for large distances in mantle transition zone in the western Pacific and other subduction zones, suggesting that the slabs meet significant resistance to their descending motion and become stagnant in the transition zone. This poses challenges to the whole mantle convection model and also brings the origin of stagnant slabs into question. Here, using a global mantle convection model with realistic spine--post-spinel phase change (-2 MPa K-1 Clapeyron slope) and plate motion history, we demonstrate that the observed stagnant slabs in the transition zone and other slab structures in the lower mantle can be explained by the presence of a thin, weak layer at the phase change boundary that was suggested by mineral physics and geoid modelling studies. Our study also shows that the stagnant slabs mostly result from subduction in the past 20--30 million years, confirming the transient nature of slab stagnation and phase change dynamics on timescales of tens of millions of years from previous studies.}

Employing advanced seismic interferometry~techniques, we calculate the space-time evolution of relative changes in seismic velocity, as a measure of hydrological properties. During 2000--2020 in basins near Los Angeles, seismic velocity variations match groundwater tables measured in wells and surface deformations inferred from satellite sensing, but the seismological approach adds temporal and depth resolutions for deep structures and processes. Maps of long-term seismic velocity changes reveal distinct patterns (decline or recovery) of groundwater storage in basins that are adjacent but adjudicated to water districts conducting different pumping practices. This pilot application bridges the gap between seismology and hydrology, and shows the promise of leveraging seismometers worldwide to provide 4D characterizations of groundwater and other near-surface systems.},

  abstract = {Heat flow studies on the exposed part of the Trans-Hudson Orogen (THO) in northern Manitoba and Saskatchewan allow constraints on crustal composition and lithosphere structure. The average of all heat flow values in the THO is the same as in other geological provinces of the Canadian Shield. However, where juvenile crust is exposed, heat flow is on average lower than in the Superior and Grenville provinces (37 vs. 41 mW m(-2)). Heat flow increases towards the surrounding Archean provinces, Rae-Hearne to the west, Sask to the south, and Superior to the east. There are strong differences in heat flow within and between the belts of the THO. The poor correlation between heat flow and heat production in the rocks exposed at the surface implies that these differences involve a large fraction of the crustal column. One new heat flow determination confirms the existence of a ``cold spot'' around the town of Lynn Lake in the northern part of the THO. Heat flow data in the Kisseynew and Glennie domains remain sparse, but they indicate that this low heat flow region extends as far south as the Flin Flon - Snow Lake Belt. The Lynn Lake Belt is underlain by poorly radiogenic rocks, possibly Kisseynew-type crust with oceanic basement. Northward increase in heat flow along the Thompson Belt is consistent with the view that the belt is thrust over Kisseynew-type basement only in the south. Heat flow increases southward in the Paleozoic basin because of higher heat production in basement rocks, probably from the Sask craton. We used the low heat flow regions to obtain an upper bound of 15 mW m(-2) for the mantle heat flow in the THO. The effective elastic thickness of the lithosphere can be determined from the coherence between the topography and the Bouguer gravity. The effective elastic thickness is high ({\textbackslash}textgreater 40 km) thoughout the Canadian Shield and is highest in the central part of the shield, in particular in the Lynn Lake region. There seems to be a negative correlation between elastic thickness and heat flow in the central and western Canadian Shield. This indicates that, even in stable continents, the elastic thickness is largely controlled by the lithospheric temperatures that depend strongly on crustal heat generation and hence crustal structure.},

They have helped understand the nature of the Mohorovicic discontinuity and the variations in seismic velocities below the Moho. Notably, heat flow studies have delineated the vertical distribution of heat producing elements throughout the crust and in the upper most mantle lithosphere. Analysis of global data sets on heat flow and crustal thickness demonstrate that there is no correlation between these two variables. This is due to the large spatial variations in crustal composition and heat production that exist within a single geological province. For a given crustal thickness, the Moho temperature varies within a wide range ({$\approx$}300K) depending on surface heat flux and crustal heat production. Thus one cannot use generic models based on a ``type'' crustal column to calculate crustal geotherms. In stable regions, lower crustal temperatures depend on the amount and vertical distribution of heat producing elements in the crust. These temperatures determine the conditions of crustal stability and impose a limit on the maximum thickness of a stabilized crust.},

  abstract = {Assessment of deep buried basin/basement relationships using geophysical data is a challenge for the energy and mining industries as well as for geothermal or CO2 storage purposes. In deep environments, few methods can provide geological information; magnetic and gravity data remain among the most informative and cost-effective methods. Here, in order to derive fast first-order information on the basement/basin interface, we propose a combination of existing and original approaches devoted to potential field data analysis. Namely, we investigate the geometry (i.e., depth and structure) and the nature of a deep buried basement through a case study SW of the Paris Basin. Joint processing of new high-resolution magnetic data and up-to-date gravity data provides an updated overview of the deep basin.First, the main structures of the magnetic basement are highlighted using Euler deconvolution and are interpreted in a structural sketch map. The new high-resolution aeromagnetic map actually offers a continuous view of regional basement structures and reveals poorly known and complex deformation at the junction between major domains of the Variscan collision belt.Second, Werner deconvolution and an ad hoc post-processing analysis allow the extraction of a set of magnetic sources at (or close to) the basin/basement interface. Interpolation of these sources together with the magnetic structural sketch provides a Werner magnetic basement map displaying realistic 3D patterns and basement depths consistent with data available in deep petroleum boreholes.The last step of processing was designed as a way to quickly combine gravity and magnetic information and to simply visualize first-order petrophysical patterns of the basement lithology. This is achieved through unsupervised classification of suitably selected gravity and magnetic maps and, as compared to previous work, provides a realistic and updated overview of the cartographic distribution of density/magnetization of basement rocks.Altogether, the three steps of processing proposed in this paper quickly provide relevant information on a deep buried basement in terms of structure, geometry and nature (through petrophysics). Notwithstanding, limitations of the proposed procedure are raised: in the case of the Paris Basin for instance, this study does not provide proper information on Pre-Mesozoic basins, some of which have been sampled in deep boreholes.},

The seismic transect provides a very clear image of the crust-mantle boundary and the most precise definition to date of the various Grenvillian terranes. The crust is around 44 km thick beneath the Grenville Front but thins rapidly to 36 km some 60 km to the southeast; it is also notable that the greatest crustal thickness of 50 km occurs at the southeast end of the transect, far from the inferred location of the main Grenvillian collision. The Grenville Front zone, in which NW directed thrusting at about 1 Ga was followed by SE directed extension, is defined by discontinuous, SE dipping reflections, which extend down to the Moho. To the southeast, the overlying migmatitic Archean parautochthon, almost half of the transect, is characterised instead by NW dipping reflectors extending into the lower crust. These reflectors are in turn truncated to the southeast by a 12-km-thick zone of intense SE dipping reflections, the Baskatong crustal ramp. The base of the allochthonous terranes (Allochthon Boundary Thrust) is likely located at this ramp, which flattens out at around 30-km depth into the base of the relatively transparent intermediate crust. A highly reflective upper crustal deck corresponding to rocks of the Mont-Laurier terrane was thrust over the Baskatong crustal ramp and is represented further to the northwest by the klippelike Cabonga allochthon. The synformal, transparent Morin anorthosite-charnockite complex belongs to the same upper crustal level. Ramp anticlines and the overriding basal thrust of the upper allochthons demonstrate the NW directed propagation of tectonic transport during the Grenvillian orogeny, involving deformation and displacement along the Baskatong ramp with a relay into the Grenville Front zone. Postaccretional extension appears to have been primarily accommodated along the latter two crustal discontinuities thinning the crust immediately south of the Grenville Front and affecting the crust up to 350 km away from the front.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Alaska has been a site of subduction and terrane accretion since the mid-Jurassic. The area features abundant seismicity, active volcanism, rapid uplift, and broad intraplate deformation, all associated with subduction of the Pacific plate beneath North America. The juxtaposition of a slab edge with subducted, overthickened crust of the Yakutat terrane beneath central Alaska is associated with many enigmatic volcanic features. The causes of the Denali Volcanic Gap, a 400-km-long zone of volcanic quiescence west of the slab edge, are debated. Furthermore, the Wrangell Volcanic Field, southeast of the volcanic gap, also has an unexplained relationship with subduction. To address these issues, we present a joint ambient noise, earthquake-based surface wave, and               P               -               S               receiver function tomography model of Alaska, along with a teleseismic               S               wave velocity model. We compare the crust and mantle structure between the volcanic and nonvolcanic regions, across the eastern edge of the slab and between models. Low crustal velocities correspond to sedimentary basins, and several terrane boundaries are marked by changes in Moho depth. The continental lithosphere directly beneath the Denali Volcanic Gap is thicker than in the adjacent volcanic region. We suggest that shallow subduction here has cooled the mantle wedge, allowing the formation of thick lithosphere by the prevention of hot asthenosphere from reaching depths where it can interact with fluids released from the slab and promote volcanism. There is no evidence for subducted material east of the edge of the Yakutat terrane, implying the Wrangell Volcanic Field formed directly above a slab edge.                        ,              Plain Language Summary             We present new images of the Alaskan subduction zone that reveal the three-dimensional structure of the upper mantle and crust. Our study leverages data from a new array of high-quality seismometers, the Transportable Array, which has been deployed across the entire state. We combine multiple geophysical techniques with complementary strengths to examine the upper 150~km over a wider geographic area than has previously been imaged. This enables us to observe major changes in crustal thickness across Alaska, map the eastern edge of the subducted Yakutat-Pacific plate, and note that the enigmatic Wrangell Volcanoes lie directly above this edge, which may help to explain their unusual features. We also observe significant differences in the mantle structure beneath a volcanic region, the Aleutian Arc, and an adjacent zone of volcanic quiescence. We infer that shallow-angle subduction beneath this region has cooled the mantle here and thus limits the production of magma for volcanoes.           ,              Key Points                                                                We use receiver functions, ambient noise, earthquake-based surface wave, and teleseismic body wave tomography to image the Alaskan subsurface                                                     Shallow subduction below the Denali Volcanic Gap prevents asthenospheric flow into zones of slab fluid release, suppressing volcanism here                                                     The edge of the subducted Yakutat terrane delineates the easternmost extent of subduction; the Wrangell Volcanic Field lies above this edge},

The sedimentary pack is approximated by a grid of 3D vertical prisms juxtaposed in both horizontal directions of a right-handed coordinate system. The prisms' thicknesses represent the depths to the basement and are the parameters to be estimated from the gravity data. To estimate the parameters defining the parabolic decay of the density contrast with depth and to produce stable depth-to-basement estimates, we imposed smoothness on the basement depths and proximity between estimated and known depths at boreholes. We applied our method to synthetic data from a simulated complex 3D basement relief with two sedimentary sections having distinct parabolic laws describing the density-contrast variation with depth. The results provide good estimates of the true parameters of the parabolic law of density-contrast decay with depth and of the basement relief. Inverting the gravity data from the onshore and part of the shallow offshore Almada Basin on Brazil's northeastern coast shows good correlation with known structural features. {\copyright} 2010 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.}

Of the basic parameters that shape and control ice flow, the most poorly known is geothermal heat flux. Direct observations of heat flux are difficult to obtain in Antarctica, and until now continent-wide heat flux maps have only been derived from low-resolution satellite magnetic and seismological data. We present a high-resolution heat flux map and associated uncertainty derived from spectral analysis of the most advanced continental compilation of airborne magnetic data. Small-scale spatial variability and features consistent with known geology are better reproduced than in previous models, between 36\% and 50\%. Our high-resolution heat flux map and its uncertainty distribution provide an important new boundary condition to be used in studies on future subglacial hydrology, ice sheet dynamics, and sea level change.},

To guess fMIM parameters from experiments, an accurate method consists in optimizing an objective function that measures how much model solutions deviate from data. We show that solving an adjoint problem helps accurate computing of the gradient of such an objective function, with respect to the parameters. We illustrate the method by applying it on experimental data issued from tracing tests in porous media.},

  abstract = {Current geodynamic models of continental collision involving (ultra)high pressure complexes imply that even deeply subducted continental crust is significantly lighter than the ultrabasic upper mantle. To test this implication, we have investigated density changes of major components of continental crust, in particular metagreywacke and metapelite, as a function of pressure and temperature using a Gibbs free energy minimization approach. Pseudosections were calculated for fixed chemical compositions and the P-T range of 10-40??kbar, 600-1000????C. Selected compositions were those of natural psammopelitic rocks, average crustal components, various theoretical mixtures of quartz, plagioclase, illite, chlorite and Fe,Ti-oxides, and finally mid-ocean ridge basalt and lherzolite for comparison. Calculated densities were presented as density maps (isochors in P-T diagrams). In general, observed densities of psammopelitic rocks increase with rising pressure due to the formation of advancing amounts of garnet, Na-pyroxene, and kyanite. A common assemblage, for instance, at 25??kbar/800????C consists of phengite, quartz, jadeite, garnet, kyanite, magnetite, and rutile. After overstepping the quartz-coesite transition the density of a mean psammopelitic rock (3.35??g/cm3) is almost as high as that of garnet lherzolite. Calculations with other pelitic compositions demonstrate that the resulting densities (up to 3.5??g/cm3) can even exceed that of a garnet lherzolite due to high contents of garnet. Our calculations suggest that (i) even non-basic crustal material can sink into the Earth's mantle to fertilize it and (ii) the proportion of low-density granitic rocks in deeply subducted continental crust must be relatively high to claim buoyancy forces for a return of this crust to the surface. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

This study reports new, high-precision 40Ar/39Ar ages for six young (300-600 ka) basalt flows from the NVP and is part of a broader initiative to constrain the extent, duration, episodicity and causation of NVP volcanism. Six fresh, holocrystalline alkali basalt flows were selected from the Warrnambool-Port Fairy area in the Western Plains sub-province for 40Ar/39Ar dating. These flows were chosen on the basis of pre-existing K-Ar age constraints, which, although variable, indicated eruption during a period of apparent relative volcanic quiescence (0.8-0.06 Ma).40Ar/39Ar ages were measured on multiple aliquots of whole rock basalt samples. Three separate flows from the Mount Rouse volcanic field yielded concordant 40Ar/39Ar age results, with a mean eruption age of 303 {\textpm} 13 ka (95\% CI). An older weighted mean age of 382 {\textpm} 24 ka (2{$\sigma$}) was obtained for one sample from the central Rouse-Port Fairy Flow, suggesting extraneous argon contamination. Two basalt flows from the Mount Warrnambool volcano also yielded analogous results, with an average 40Ar/39Ar age of 542 {\textpm} 17 ka (95\% CI). The results confirm volcanic activity during the interval of relative quiescence. Most previous K-Ar ages for these flows are generally older than the weighted mean 40Ar/39Ar ages, suggesting the presence of extraneous 40Ar. This study demonstrates the suitability of the 40Ar/39Ar incremental-heating method to obtain precise eruption ages for young, holocrystalline alkali basalt samples in the NVP. {\copyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

We examine the degree to which the thermal structure of the crust can be constrained from the Curie depth and surface heat flow data in Southeastern Australia. We cast the inverse problem of heat conduction within a Bayesian framework and derive its adjoint so that we can efficiently find the optimal model that best reproduces the data and prior information on the thermal properties of the crust. Efficiency gains obtained from the adjoint method facilitate a detailed exploration of thermal structure in SE Australia, where we predict high temperatures within Precambrian rocks of 650 {\textopenbullet}C due to relatively high rates of heat production (0.9--1.4 {$\mu$}W m-3). In contrast, temperatures within dominantly Phanerozoic crust reach only 520 {\textopenbullet}C at the Moho due to the low rates of heat production in Cambrian mafic volcanics. A combination of the Curie depth and heat flow data is required to constrain the uncertainty of lower crustal temperatures to {\textpm}73 {\textopenbullet}C. We also show that parts of the crust are unconstrained if either data set is omitted from the inversion.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Curie depth offers a valuable constraint on the thermal structure of the lithosphere, based on its interpretation as the depth to 580\&thinsp;{$\circ$}C, but current methods underestimate the range of uncertainty. We formulate the estimation of Curie depth within a Bayesian framework to quantify its uncertainty across the British Isles. Uncertainty increases exponentially with Curie depth but this can be moderated by increasing the size of the spatial window taken from the magnetic anomaly. The choice of window size needed to resolve the magnetic thickness is often ambiguous but, based on our chosen spectral method, we determine that significant gains in precision can be obtained with window sizes 15--30 times larger than the deepest magnetic source. Our Curie depth map of the British Isles includes a combination of window sizes: smaller windows are used where the magnetic base is shallow to resolve small-scale features, and larger window sizes are used where the magnetic base is deep in order to improve precision. On average, the Curie depth increases from Laurentian crust (22.2{\textpm}5.3\&thinsp;km) to Avalonian crust (31.2{\textpm}9.2\&thinsp;km). The temperature distribution in the crust, and associated uncertainty, was simulated from the ensemble of Curie depth realizations assigned to a lower thermal boundary condition of a crustal model (sedimentary thickness, Moho depth, heat production, thermal conductivity), constructed from various geophysical and geochemical datasets. The uncertainty in the simulated heat flow field substantially increases from {\textpm}10\&thinsp;mW\&thinsp;m-2 for shallow Curie depths at {$\sim$}15\&thinsp;km to {\textpm}80\&thinsp;mW\&thinsp;m-2 for Curie depths {\textbackslash}textgreater40\&thinsp;km. Surface heat flow observations are concordant with the simulated heat flow field except in regions that contain igneous bodies. Heat flow data within large batholiths in the British Isles exceed the simulated heat flow by {$\sim$}25\&thinsp;mW\&thinsp;m-2 as a result of their high rates of heat production (4--6\&thinsp;{\textmu}W\&thinsp;m-3). Conversely, heat refraction around thermally resistive mafic volcanics and thick sedimentary layers induce a negative heat flow misfit of a similar magnitude. A northward thinning of the lithosphere is supported by shallower Curie depths on the northern side of the Iapetus Suture, which separates Laurentian and Avalonian terranes. Cenozoic volcanism in Northern Britain and Ireland has previously been attributed to a lateral branch of the proto-Icelandic mantle plume. Our results show that high surface heat flow ({\textbackslash}textgreater90\&thinsp;mW\&thinsp;m-2) and shallow Curie depth ({$\sim$}15\&thinsp;km) occur within the same region, which supports the hypothesis that lithospheric thinning occurred due to the influence of a mantle plume. The fact that the uncertainty is only {\textpm}3--8\&thinsp;km in this region demonstrates that Curie depths are more reliable in hotter regions of the crust where the magnetic base is shallow. ]]{\textbackslash}textgreater},

Large-scale models play a key role in determining long range flow pathways from continental interiors to the oceans, yet struggle to simulate the local flow patterns offered by small-scale models. We have developed a highly scalable numerical framework to model continental groundwater flow which capture the intricate flow pathways between deep aquifers and the near-surface. The coupled thermal-hydraulic basin structure is inferred from hydraulic head measurements, recharge estimates from geochemical proxies, and borehole temperature data using a Bayesian framework. We use it to model the deep groundwater flow beneath the Sydney--Gunnedah--Bowen Basin, part of Australia's largest aquifer system. Coastal aquifers have flow rates of up to 0.3~m/day, and a corresponding groundwater residence time of just 2,000~years. In contrast, our model predicts slow flow rates of 0.005~m/day for inland aquifers, resulting in a groundwater residence time of                                                   \$\${\textbackslash}sim \$\$                                        {$\sim$}                                                                  ~400,000 years. Perturbing the model to account for a drop in borehole water levels since 2000, we find that lengthened inland flow pathways depart significantly from pre-2000 streamlines as groundwater is drawn further from recharge zones in a drying climate. Our results illustrate that progressively increasing water extraction from inland aquifers may permanently alter long-range flow pathways. Our open-source modelling approach can be extended to any basin and may help inform policies on the sustainable management of groundwater.},

  abstract = {In 2011, the British Geological Survey (BGS) decided to begin the assembly of a National Geological Model (NGM) from its existing and on-going geological framework models comprising integrated national crustal, bedrock, and Quaternary models. The bedrock component is the most advanced of these themes and comprises both the calculated models and a complementary network of cross sections that provide a fence diagram for the bedrock geology of Great Britain. This fence diagram, the GB3D\_v2012 dataset, is the subject of this article and is available in a variety of formats from the BGS website (www.bgs.ac.uk) as free downloads. It complements the existing 1:625 000 scale map sheets published by BGS utilizing the same colour schema and geological classification. The 121 component cross sections extend to depths between 1.5 and 6 km; they have an aggregate length of over 20 000 km, and they are snapped together at their intersections to ensure total consistency. The sections are guided by the existing BGS geological framework models where they cut through them; they also take account of the vast wealth of published data on the subsurface structure of Britain both from BGS and in the literature. Much of this is in the form of cross sections, contour maps of surfaces, and thicknesses (isopachs). The fence diagram has been built in the Geological Surveying and Investigation in 3D (GSI3D) software. Utilizing the cross sections and the coverages of the geological units simple 3D volumes can be calculated for the less deformed sedimentary strata. It is envisaged that this dataset will form a useful educational resource for geoscience students and the general public, and also provide the bedrock geology context and structure for regional and catchment scale studies.},

  abstract = {The surface heat flow field in Australia has for many years been poorly constrained compared to continental regions elsewhere. 182 recent heat flow determinations and 66 new heat production measurements for Southeastern Australia significantly increase our understanding of local and regional lithospheric thermal regimes and allow for detailed thermal modelling. The new data give a mean surface heat flow for Victoria of 71 {\textpm} 15mWm-2 which fits within the 61--77mWm-2 range reported for Phanerozoic-aged crust globally. These data reveal three new thermally and compositionally distinct heat flow sub-provinces within the previously defined Eastern Heat Flow Province: the Delamerian heat flow sub-province (average surface heat flow 60 {\textpm} 9mWm-2); the Lachlan heat flow sub-province (average surface heat flow 74 {\textpm} 13mWm-2); and the Newer Volcanics heat flow sub-province (average surface heat flow 72 {\textpm} 16mWm-2) which includes extreme values that locally exceed 100mWm-2. Inversions of reduced heat flow and crustal differentiation find that the Delamerian sub-province has experienced significant crustal reworking compared to the Lachlan and Newer Volcanics sub-provinces. The latter has experienced volcanism within the last 8Ma and the degree of variability observed in surface heat flow points (up to 8mWm-2 per kilometre laterally) cannot be replicated with steady-state thermal models through this sub-province. In the absence of a strong palaeoclimate signal, aquifer disturbances, or highly enriched granites, we suggest that this high variability arises from localised transient perturbations to the upper crust associated with recent intraplate volcanism. This is supported by a strong spatial correlation of high surface heat flow and known eruption points within the Newer Volcanics heat flow sub-province.},

Mass redistribution produces perturbations to the inertia tensor, and the planet must reorient to adjust to the new orientation of the maximum principal axis. The amount of reorientation depends on the competing sizes of the applied load and the remnant bulge. For tidally deformed satellites in synchronous rotation, the slow rotation and correspondingly small remnant bulge makes them prone to reorientation. Reorientation can generate gravity and topography perturbations and large tectonic stresses. Observational constraints based on gravity, tectonic, and paleomagnetic data suggest that many Solar System bodies appear to have undergone significant reorientation.},

  abstract = {Our present understanding of the mantle carbon budget is in part built upon measurements of carbon concentrations in olivine hosted melt inclusions. Only a small number of such datasets are thought to have avoided degassing, having been entrapped prior to CO2 vapour saturation, and are therefore able to constrain primary CO2 concentrations. The absence of degassing in melt inclusion datasets has been inferred from the presence of strong correlations between CO2 and trace elements. In this contribution, we demonstrate that partial degassing followed by magma mixing not only retains such positive correlations, but can enhance them. Simple models of magma mixing and degassing are used to characterise how CO2-trace element systematics respond to CO2 vapour saturation in primary mantle melts entering the crust, followed by magma mixing. Positive correlations are expected between CO2 and most trace elements, and the average CO2/Ba and CO2/Nb ratios are controlled by the pressure of magma storage, rather than the CO2 concentration in the mantle. We find that the best estimates of mantle CO2 are the maximum CO2/Ba ratios observed in melt inclusion datasets, though a large number of analyses are required to adequately characterise the maximum of the CO2/Ba distribution. Using the mixing and degassing models we estimate the number of analyses required to obtain a maximum CO2/Ba observation within 10\% of the mantle value. In light of our results, we reassess existing melt inclusion datasets, and find they exhibit systematics associated with partial degassing and mixing. We argue that all the data presently available is consistent with a depleted mantle CO2/Ba ratio of {$\sim$}140, and there is as yet no evidence for heterogeneity in the CO2/Ba ratio of the depleted mantle.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the results of 34 new heat flow estimates taken in 2004 from 16 water bores and 18 petroleum exploration wells in the western Otway Basin. The average estimated heat flow measured across the study area is 65.6 {\textpm} 9.4 mW/m2, with a range of 42--90 mW/m2. There are three recognisable sectors within the study area where heat flow is slightly elevated relative to the background levels. These sectors can be broadly classified as Mount Schank (73.5 {\textpm} 0.5 mW/m2), Mount Burr (71.2 {\textpm} 7.6 mW/m2) and Beachport (78.3 {\textpm} 10.4 mW/m2). Thermal conductivity values for each unit involved in heat flow estimation were determined from laboratory measurements on representative core using a divided bar apparatus. Borehole thermal conductivity profiles were then developed in this study by assigning a constant value of conductivity to each geological formation. The process of collecting temperature data involved measuring temperature profiles for 16 water bores using a cable, winch and thermistor, and compiling well completion temperature data from 18 petroleum wells. The precision of temperature data was higher in the water bores (continuous logs) than in the petroleum wells (largely bottom-of-hole temperature estimates). Inversion heat flow modelling suggests heterogeneous heat flow at 6000 m depth, with two zones where vertical heat flow might exceed 90 mW/m2, and several zones where vertical heat flow might be as low as 40 mW/m2. Therefore, while slightly higher surface heat flow does coincide with some of the volcanic centres, heterogeneous basement heat production is a more likely explanation, as there are no heat flow anomalies greater than 5--10 mW/m2 associated with the Pleistocene--Recent Newer Volcanics Province. The distribution of heat flow in south-east South Australia is most simply explained by non-volcanic phenomena.},

This limited depth extent of the crustal magnetization is discernible in the power spectra of magnetic maps of South Africa and Central Asia. At short wavelengths, the power increases as rapidly towards longer wavelengths as expected for a self-similar magnetized crust with unlimited depth extent. Above wavelengths of about 100 km the power starts increasing less rapidly, indicating the absence of deep-seated sources. To quantify this effect we derive the theoretical power spectrum due to a slab carved out of a self-similar magnetization distribution. This model power spectrum matches the power spectra of South Africa and Central Asia for a self-similarity parameter of \{beta\} = 4 and Curie temperature depths of 15 to 20 km.},

This approach is applicable only if the gas, oil, and brine phases are mixed uniformly at a very small scale, so the different wave-induced increments of pore pressure in each phase have time to diffuse and equilibrate during a seismic period. In contrast, saturations that are heterogeneous over scales larger than the characteristic diffusion length, i.e., patchy saturation, will always lead to higher seismic velocities than if the same fluids are mixed uniformly at a fine scale. Critical saturation scales separating uniform from patchy behavior are typically of the order 0.1-1 cm for laboratory measurements and tens of centimeters for field seismic frequencies. For low seismic frequencies, velocities corresponding to patchy and homogeneous saturations represent approximate upper and lower bounds for given saturations and dry rock properties. For well-consolidated rocks, both bounds can be estimated easily using Gassmann's relations with Voigt and Reuss average effective fluids, respectively.},

The method is relatively independent of assumptions about idealized pore geometries and unknown parameters such as pore aspect ratios. The local flow effect depends on the heterogeneity of pore stiffness, in particular the presence of compliant cracks and grain contacts; the pressure dependence of the dry rock properties is shown to contain the essential information about the distribution of pore stiffnesses needed to estimate the high-frequency saturated behavior. To first order, the unrelaxed wet frame compressibility at any given pressure is shown to be approximately the dry frame compressibility at very high pressure; sec- ond order corrections add the additional compressibility gained by replacing an amount of mineral equal to the compliant pore volume with fluid. The method predicts that the difference between relaxed and unrelaxed shear compliance is simply proportional to that in bulk. The results for total dispersion (local flow plus Biot) explain quite well the measured P- and S-wave dispersion for a variety of saturated rocks.}

The physical assumption that the compliant porosity is crack-like means that the pressure dependence of the generalized compliances is governed primarily by normal tractions resolved across cracks and defects. This allows the measured pressure dependence to be mapped from the hydrostatic stress state to any applied nonhydrostatic stress. Predicted P- and S-wave velocities agree reasonably well with uniaxial stress data for Barre Granite and Massillon Sandstone. While it is mechanically similar to methods based on idealized ellipsoidal cracks, the approach is relatively independent of any assumed crack geometry and is not limited to small crack densities.}

For a fixed porosity, an increase in pore space compressibility increases the sensitivity of the modulus to fluid substitution. Two simple techniques, based on pore compressibility, are presented for graphically applying Gassmann's relation for fluid substitution. In the first method, the pore compressibility is simply reweighted with a factor that depends only on the ratio of fluid to mineral bulk modulus. In the second tech- nique, the rock moduli are resealed using the Reuss average, which again depends only on the fluid and mineral moduli.},

Apparent exhumation (maximum burial depth--present burial depth) for the Cooper Basin has been quantified using the compaction methodology. The results show that exhumation of the Cooper Basin for the majority of the wells is greater than the exhumation of the Eromanga Basin. Using the compaction methodology, apparent exhumation of Early to Middle Triassic age Arrabury and Tinchoo Formatios has been quantified. Both units yield similar results and do not support that the Arrabury/Tinchoo boundary represents the Cooper--Eromanga boundary. Hence, the Cooper Basin is believed to have reached its maximum burial depth in Late Triassic times. Sonic log data are not available for the units overlying the Late Cretaceous Winton Formation; thus, it is not possible to date exhumation beyond the Late Cretaceous--Tertiary using the compaction methodology. Tertiary sequences as are preserved are relatively thin and separated by marked unconformities and weathered surfaces; hence, exhumation rather than sedimentation dominated the Tertiary, and in exhumed areas, maximum burial depth was attained in Late Cretaceous times. The burial/exhumation history of representative wells was synthesized using sediment decompaction and establishing porosity/depth relations for the Cooper--Eromanga units. Considering the relative significance of the major periods of exhumation in the Cooper/Eromanga Basins, three broad types of burial/exhumation histories can be distinguished. Maximum burial depth of the Cooper Basin sequence was attained before the deposition of the Eromanga Basin sequence, i.e. Late Triassic--Early Jurassic times; maximum burial depth of the Cooper and Eromanga Basin sequences attained in Late Cretaceous times; and Cooper and Eromanga Basin sequences are currently at maximum burial-depth. Incorporation of exhumation into burial history has major implications for hydrocarbon exploration.},

Additionally, all of the implementations presented here are developed such that the computations can be performed in a massively parallel, distributed memory computing environment. Through numerical experiments, we compare the methods on the basis of their discretization error, CPU time and parallel scalability.

Using 3D gravity modelling, the first order configuration of the crystalline crust has been resolved with respect to the location of the continent--ocean boundary. The distribution of a high-density lower crustal layer indicates a continuous body extending below the Cretaceous-Cenozoic depocentres and aligned parallel to the coast line. In addition, high-density zones within the continental crystalline crust had to be included in the model to fit observed and calculated gravity. The obtained Moho topography correlates with the major tectonic units of this continental margin. The results of the 3D thermal modelling indicate that there is a clear relationship between the location of thickened sediments and areas with increased temperatures within the upper 10km of the 3D model. This indicates that the low thermal conductivity of the sediments increases heat storage within the areas covered by thick sediments. Within the deeper crust, the main feature of the temperature distribution is the transition across the continental margin from the relatively cold oceanic part to the warm continental one. This regional pattern is controlled by the thickness of the crystalline continental crust, which is characterized by an increased radiogenic heat production. At a depth of 80--90km, the temperature becomes higher beneath the oceanic domain than beneath the continent, reflecting the configuration of the lower thermal boundary which is represented by an isothermal lithosphere--asthenosphere boundary.},

  abstract = {Intraplate magmatic provinces found away from plate boundaries provide direct sampling of the composition and heterogeneity of the Earth's mantle. The chemical heterogeneities that have been observed in the mantle are usually attributed to recycling during subduction1--3, which allows for the addition of volatiles and incompatible elements into the mantle. Although many intraplate volcanoes sample deep-mantle reservoirs---possibly at the core--mantle boundary4---not all intraplate volcanoes are deep-rooted5, and reservoirs in other, shallower boundary layers are likely to participate in magma generation. Here we present evidence that suggests Bermuda sampled a previously unknown mantle domain, characterized by silica-undersaturated melts that are substantially enriched in incompatible elements and volatiles, and a unique, extreme isotopic signature. To our knowledge, Bermuda records the most radiogenic 206Pb/204Pb isotopes that have been documented in an ocean basin (with 206Pb/204Pb ratios of 19.9--21.7) using high-precision methods. Together with low 207Pb/204Pb ratios (15.5--15.6) and relatively invariant Sr, Nd, and Hf isotopes, the data suggest that this source must be less than 650 million years old. We therefore interpret the Bermuda source as a previously unknown, transient mantle reservoir that resulted from the recycling and storage of incompatible elements and volatiles6--8 in the transition zone (between the upper and lower mantle), aided by the fractionation of lead in a mineral that is stable only in this boundary layer, such as K-hollandite9,10. We suggest that recent recycling into the transition zone, related to subduction events during the formation of Pangea, is the reason why this reservoir has only been found in the Atlantic Ocean. Our geodynamic models suggest that this boundary layer was sampled by disturbances related to mantle flow. Seismic studies and diamond inclusions6,7 have shown that recycled materials can be stored in the transition zone11. For the first time, to our knowledge, we show geochemical evidence that this storage is key to the generation of extreme isotopic domains that were previously thought to be related only to deep recycling.}

  abstract = {The role of subducted oceanic lithospheric slabs in determining the composition and secular evolution of the Earth's mantle and continental crust is examined. In the Archean, it is argued that the behaviour of subducted slabs is largely determined by partial melting reactions at relatively shallow levels ({\textbackslash}textless200 km) in the upper mantle, a consequence of the younger mean age of subducted slabs. As a result, subducted Archean slabs are dehydrated and largely disaggregated in the uppermost 100-200 km of the mantle. This is likely to have had a dramatic effect on mantle convection due to the inability of subducted slabs to transport volatiles beyond this level and into the deep mantle. A low viscosity upper mantle "lid" forms which is largely isolated from the lower mantle. It is proposed that the positive epsilon (sub Nd) values characteristic of many early Archean rocks are due to derivation of magmas from this highly depleted zone of uppermost mantle. In the post-Archean mantle, lower temperatures and reduced heat flow result in the formation of older, colder and stronger oceanic lithosphere which mainly underdoes dehydration rather than partial melting reactions during subduction. This allows slabs to penetrate through the relatively high viscosity transition zone (400-670 km deep) and into the lower mantle. Consequently, an influx of volatiles (predominantly H (sub 2) O and CO (sub 2) ) and some relatively mobile elements such as U are carried into the deep mantle via post-Archean subduction. The post-Archean fluxing of U into the deep mantle can account for both the Pb paradox as well as the lower than anticipated Th/U ratios observed in modern mid-ocean ridge basalts. It is also proposed that the formation of the source region of chemically distinct ocean island basalts is a feature largely restricted to the post-Archean mantle. This is a consequence of the relatively short lifetime of recycled slabs in the Archean ({\textbackslash}textless10 (super 8) yrs) compared to the post-Archean ({\textbackslash}textgreater10 (super 9) yrs). Subducted slabs thus play a critical role in controlling the evolving styles of mantle convection, as well as the interaction between the mantle and the continental crust.},

  abstract = {Compositional models of the Earth are critically dependent on three main sources of information: the seismic profile of the Earth and its interpretation, comparisons between primitive meteorites and the solar nebula composition, and chemical and petrological models of peridotite-basalt melting relationships. Whereas a family of compositional models for the Earth are permissible based on these methods, the model that is most consistent with the seismological and geodynamic structure of the Earth comprises an upper and lower mantle of similar composition, an FeNi core having between 5\% and 15\% of a low-atomic-weight element, and a mantle which, when compared to CI carbonaceous chondrites, is depleted in Mg and Si relative to the refractory lithophile elements. The absolute and relative abundances of the refractory elements in carbonaceous, ordinary, and enstatite chondritic meteorites are compared. The bulk composition of an average CI carbonaceous chondrite is defined from previous compilations and from the refractory element compositions of different groups of chondrites. The absolute uncertainties in their refractory element compositions are evaluated by comparing ratios of these elements. These data are then used to evaluate existing models of the composition of the Silicate Earth. The systematic behavior of major and trace elements during differentiation of the mantle is used to constrain the Silicate Earth composition. Seemingly fertile peridotites have experienced a previous melting event that must be accounted for when developing these models. The approach taken here avoids unnecessary assumptions inherent in several existing models, and results in an internally consistent Silicate Earth composition having chondritic proportions of the refractory lithophile elements at {$\sim$} 2.75 times that in CI carbonaceous chondrites. Element ratios in peridotites, komatiites, basalts and various crustal rocks are used to assess the abundances of both non-lithophile and non-refractory elements in the Silicate Earth. These data provide insights into the accretion processes of the Earth, the chemical evolution of the Earth's mantle, the effect of core formation, and indicate negligible exchange between the core and mantle throughout the geologic record (the last 3.5 Ga). The composition of the Earth's core is poorly constrained beyond its major constituents (i.e. an FeNi alloy). Density contrasts between the inner and outer core boundary are used to suggest the presence ({$\sim$} 10 {\textpm} 5\%) of a light element or a combination of elements (e.g., O, S, Si) in the outer core. The core is the dominant repository of siderophile elements in the Earth. The limits of our understanding of the core's composition (including the light-element component) depend on models of core formation and the class of chondritic meteorites we have chosen when constructing models of the bulk Earth's composition. The Earth has a bulk Fe Al of {$\sim$} 20 {\textpm} 2, established by assuming that the Earth's budget of Al is stored entirely within the Silicate Earth and Fe is partitioned between the Silicate Earth ({$\sim$} 14\%) and the core ({$\sim$} 86\%). Chondritic meteorites display a range of Fe Al ratios, with many having a value close to 20. A comparison of the bulk composition of the Earth and chondritic meteorites reveals both similarities and differences, with the Earth being more strongly depleted in the more volatile elements. There is no group of meteorites that has a bulk composition matching that of the Earth's. {\copyright} 1995.}

Some geodynamic models attribute Early Mesozoic Atlantic rifting and magmatism to a large mantle plume. However, the central Atlantic basalts occur in overlapping provinces of distinct dike trends and compositional types, not as magmas generated from a single plume-style source. Continental rifting was active for 25 m.y. before and after the magmatic event, during which rifting and magmatism evolved into a spreading ocean crust. Rift basalts within the continents may be contemporaneous with a large basalt wedge that marks the eastern North American margin at the start of ocean-crust production, but there are no Jurassic hotspot tracks in the Atlantic Ocean crust, and the much younger alkalic 'hotspots' in the eastern Atlantic Ocean cannot be linked to the rift basalts. Thus, there is no physical evidence of a plume mechanism for Early Mesozoic Pangaean rifting and magmatism. Several convection cells beneath the rift zone may be responsible for both tectonic basins and basaltic magmas, as influenced by pre-existing lithospheric structures. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

To test this resemblance further the ratio of these anomalies, 2, is obtained as a function of wavelength for a variety of simple two-dimensional convective flows. These calculations show that the ratio is insensitive to the Rayleigh number and the degree of internal heating, but is strongly affected by viscosity variations and the depth of the convecting layer. When the viscosity depends on temperature both the surface deformation and the gravity anomaly may be negative over rising regions. Comparison with available observational evidence suggests that variations of viscosity with temperature are dominant only in the vicinity of island arcs.},

Since Vs is principally controlled by temperature, rather than by composition, it can be used to map the lithospheric thickness. Extensive regions of thick lithosphere underlie some, but not all, cratons. Conversely, thick lithosphere underlies some platforms and belts of active deformation. Because of this lack of correspondence, and because their age cannot be determined from seismology, we refer to regions of thick lithosphere as 'cores' rather than 'cratons'. The shape of such cores has controlled the geometry of continental deformation and the distribution of diamond-bearing kimberlites. The strength of the cores resides in the dry crust, which is insulated from the hot convecting mantle by the thick buoyant lithosphere. The most surprising feature is the presence of thick lithosphere beneath Tibet and Iran, whose velocity structure closely resembles that of the cores beneath cratons, though they have a thicker hotter crust. Tibet and Iran appear to be places where cratons are now being formed. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The displacement required to produce melting depends on the magnitude of the regional stress and also on the friction stress. If both stresses are one kilobar melting can occur for displacements as small as one millimetre. If, however, both stresses are ten bars melting is impossible for any observed displacement. It is estimated that the width of the melted zone could be between 2 mm and lcm. Melting on fault planes during earthquakes is not in disagreement with geological and geophysical observations, and suggests a new explanation for some mylonites. Melting may be important because the molten film rock formed on the fault may act as a lubricant and in the case of large earthquakes allow the release of almost all the elastic strain in the region of the shock. This would provide an important constraint in estimating the state of stress along a fault.}

Many of these phases have been named; these and many more unnamed events are defined as orogenic phases (local components) of the Caledonian Orogeny.

Seismic evidence for the presence of relatively cool mantle together with the lack of evidence for neotectonic processes normally associated with thermal transients suggests that anomalous heat flow must reflect crustal radiogenic sources (U, Th and K). This is supported by a compilation of more than 6000 analyses from 455 individual granites, granitic gneisses and felsic volcanics which shows that the present-day average heat production of these rock types is 4.6 {\textmu}Wm--3 when normalised by area of outcrop (over more than 100 000 km2); roughly twice that of `average' granite. At the time of this felsic magmatism (ca 1850--1500 Ma) heat production rates were some 25--30\% greater than the present day such that the total complement of U, Th and K in many parts of the Australian Proterozoic crust may have contributed as much as 60--85 mWm--2 to the surface heat flow, or 2 to 3 times the present-day continental average.

The largely non-magnetic upper crust (folded Ordovician to Lower Devonian strata of the Melbourne Zone intruded by Devonian granite plutons) has been modelled using recently acquired density measurements, providing a good match with the gravity profiles. The top of the basement is modelled at*10--15 km depth in the centre of the zone, and*8--10 km depth in the south of the zone, reflecting a thinning of the folded cover sequence toward the south, consistent with outcrops of basement Cambrian rocks on the south coast of Victoria. Long-wavelength magnetic anomalies in the Melbourne Zone are modelled as highly magnetic tabular bodies lying in the basement below the folded strata of the Melbourne Zone. The only rock type that matches the density and magnetic susceptibility is serpentinised ultramafic rock. Thus, a large ophiolitic body is thought to exist in the upper part of the basement to the Melbourne Zone, at depths of 15--25 km in the central part of the zone, and 10--15 km in the south of the zone.

In this paper, we address two of them: first, the computational cost of sensitivity (Jacobian) matrices and, second, the evaluation of the relative weights of different types of data. Regarding the first, we revise the adjoint state equations to propose a form whose cost is independent of the number of unknown parameters and only grows with the number of observation wells. Regarding the second, we derive expressions for the relative weights of different types of data. These expressions are based on minimizing the expected likelihood, rather than the likelihood itself. The efficiency of both improvements is tested on a synthetic example. The example analyzes a wide range of groundwater flow and solute transport conditions. Yet, the expected likelihood consistently yields the optimal weights. The proposed form of the adjoint state equations leads to one order of magnitude reduction in CPU time with respect to the conventional sensitivity equations.},

The latter might be due to a broader than previously reported 400-km discontinuity where the minerals co-exist with water induced melt. From our models of transition zone thickness and S-wave velocity we estimated lateral variations of temperature and water content in Earth's mantle transition zone, linearly relating variations in S-wave velocity and transition zone thickness to variations in temperature and water content. Within the transition zone we observe relatively cold subduction zones as well as relatively warm regions beneath continents and hot spots.

  abstract = {The differentiation of basaltic magmas to form more silica-rich magma is a fundamental process in crustal magmatism. However, suites of volcanic rocks erupted from individual volcanic centres rarely exhibit a compositional continuum between basalt and rhyolite. Instead, some rock suites exhibit marked compositional gaps. The origin of such gaps has been attributed to partial melting of the crust, the immiscibility of different magma types, crystallization of specific mineral phases and processes occurring within magma chambers. Here we couple high pressure and temperature experiments on mantle-derived basalt from St Vincent Volcano, Lesser Antilles, with variable water contents, to thermal models of magma differentiation. We show that the compositional distribution of the derivative magma varies as a function of water and heat content of the magmatic system, which is, in turn, related to the flux and duration of magma input. Systems that have relatively low heat content are characterized by compositional gaps, whose extent varies systemically with the water in the parent basalt. Irrespective of water content, compositional gaps diminish with time. Our approach can be used to retrieve information from volcanic rocks on their magmatic heat and water content in the parent basalt and hence explore these parameters as functions of tectonic settings and age.}

In some cases, such pre-eruption activity has served as a sufficient warning to those living in the vicinity to evacuate and avoid calamity. Precursor events seem to be related to the formation of a magma pathway to the surface, but their precise interpretation is a long-standing puzzle. It has been inferred from theoretical studies that exsolution of volatiles might create an almost separate gas pocket at the tip of a propagating dyke. Here we explain the role that such a process may have, using a laboratory study of the transient propagation of a liquid-filled crack with a gas pocket at its tip that grows with time. We show that once the gas pocket acquires sufficient buoyancy to overcome the fracture resistance of the host solid the dynamics of the gas pocket, rather than those of the liquid, determine the velocity of the crack tip. Furthermore, we find that the gas can ultimately separate from the liquid. We propose that fast-moving, gas-rich pockets reaching the surface ahead of the main liquid-filled fissure could be the origin of many precursor eruptions.},

  abstract = {Recent progress in plate tectonic reconstructions has seen models move beyond the classical idea of continental drift by attempting to reconstruct the full evolving configuration of tectonic plates and plate boundaries. A particular problem for the Neoproterozoic and Cambrian is that many existing interpretations of geological and palaeomagnetic data have remained disconnected from younger, better-constrained periods in Earth history. An important test of deep time reconstructions is therefore to demonstrate the continuous kinematic viability of tectonic motions across multiple supercontinent cycles. We present, for the first time, a continuous full-plate model spanning 1 Ga to the present-day, that includes a revised and improved model for the Neo\- proterozoic--Cambrian (1000--520 Ma) that connects with models of the Phanerozoic, thereby opening up preGondwana times for quantitative analysis and further regional refinements. In this contribution, we first sum\- marise methodological approaches to full-plate modelling and review the existing full-plate models in order to select appropriate models that produce a single continuous model. Our model is presented in a palaeomagnetic reference frame, with a newly-derived apparent polar wander path for Gondwana from 540 to 320 Ma, and a global apparent polar wander path from 320 to 0 Ma. We stress, though while we have used palaeomagnetic data when available, the model is also geologically constrained, based on preserved data from past-plate boundaries. This study is intended as a first step in the direction of a detailed and self-consistent tectonic reconstruction for the last billion years of Earth history, and our model files are released to facilitate community development.},

However, previous compilations have stopped short of mapping the locations of rifts and subduction zones continuously since the Neoproterozoic and within a self-consistent plate kinematic framework. Using recently published plate models with continuously closing boundaries for the Neoproterozoic and Phanerozoic, we estimate how rift and peri-continental subduction length vary from 1 Ga to present and test hypotheses pertaining to the supercontinent cycle and supercontinent breakup. We extract measures of continental perimeter-to-area ratio as a proxy for the existence of a supercontinent, where during times of supercontinent existence the perimeter-to-area ratio should be low, and during assembly and dispersal it should be high. The amalgamation of Gondwana is clearly represented by changes in the length of peri-continental subduction and the breakup of Rodinia and Pangea by changes in rift lengths. The assembly of Pangea is not clearly defined using plate boundary lengths, likely because its formation resulted from the collision of only two large continents. Instead the assembly of Gondwana (ca. 520 Ma) marks the most prominent change in arc length and perimeter-to-area ratio during the last billion years suggesting that Gondwana during the Early Palaeozoic could explicitly be considered part of a Phanerozoic supercontinent. Consequently, the traditional understanding of the supercontinent cycle, in terms of supercontinent existence for short periods of time before dispersal and re-accretion, may be inadequate to fully describe the cycle. Instead, either a two-stage supercontinent cycle could be a more appropriate concept, or alternatively the time period of 1 to 0 Ga has to be considered as being dominated by supercontinent existence, with brief periods of dispersal and amalgamation.},

  abstract = {The subduction of upper oceanic lithosphere acts as a primary driver of Earth's deep carbon and water cycles, providing a key transportation mechanism between surface systems and the deep Earth. Carbon and water are stored and transported in altered oceanic lithosphere. In this study, we present mass estimates of the subducted carbon and serpentinite flux from 320 to 0 Ma. Flux estimates are calculated using a full-plate tectonic reconstruction to build a descriptive model of oceanic lithosphere at points along mid-ocean ridges. These points then track the kinematic evolution of the lithosphere until subduction. To address uncertainties of modeled spreading rates in synthetic ocean basins, we consider the preserved recent (83--0 Ma) spreading history of the Pacific Ocean to be representative of the Panthalassa Ocean. This analysis suggests present-day subducting upper oceanic lithosphere contains 10--39 Mt/a of carbon and 900--3500 Mt/a of serpentinite ({$\sim$}150--450 Mt/a of water). The highest rates of carbon delivery to trenches (20--100 Mt/a) occurred during the Early Cretaceous, as upper oceanic lithosphere subducted during this period formed in times of warm bottom water and the Cretaceous period experienced high seafloor production and consumption rates. Additionally, there are several episodes of high serpentinite delivery to trenches over the last 100 Ma, driven by extensive serpentinization of mantle peridotites exposed at slow spreading ridges. We propose variations in subduction regimes act as the principal control on the subduction of carbon stored in upper oceanic lithosphere, as since 320 Ma the volume of stored carbon across all ocean basins varies by less than an order of magnitude. For pre-Pangea times ({\textbackslash}textless300 Ma), this suggests estimates of seafloor consumption represent a reasonable first-order approximation of carbon delivery. Serpentinite and associated water flux at subduction zones appear to be primarily controlled by the spreading regime at mid-ocean ridges. This is apparent during times of supercontinent breakup where slow spreading ridges produce highly serpentinized crust, and is observed in the present-day Atlantic, Arctic and Indian oceans, where our model suggests upper oceanic lithosphere is up to {$\sim$}100 times more enriched in serpentinite than the Panthalassa and Pacific oceans.},

  abstract = {Summary             In this paper, we present three-dimensional numerical simulations in which a compositional mantle plume rises through a shallow mantle layer at the rear of a retreating slab. The slab--plume buoyancy flux ratio Bs/Bp is varied from 3 to 30 over nine slab--plume simulations. The plume causes an overall decrease of the slab retreat rate from 15 to 7\% in the corresponding range Bs/Bp = [3, 30]. The retreat rate decrease occurs in two stages: the first decrease occurs remotely when plume and slab are hundreds of kilometres apart; the second decrease is linked to the slab--plume-head impact. Continuous tracking of key positions along the plume head and conduit together with velocity profiling further shows a very close interplay between the conduit and plume head dynamics. In particular, the combination of the slab-- and plume(head)--induced flows at the rear of the slab increases the advection and tilt of the conduit and causes its flaring with height in the direction parallel to the trench. As a result, the conduit source slowly drifts away from the slab by hundreds of kilometres and flares by one and a half times its original radius over 30~Myr of plume head spreading. The conduit tilt and flaring result in an increasingly unbalanced azimuthal distribution of the incoming plume flux from the feeding conduit into the head. These changes in the feeding conditions coupled with the mantle flow at the level of the plume head lead to the asymmetric spreading of plume material beneath the plate in the preferential direction that is parallel to the trench. Upon its arrival against the slab, it can be a front of buoyant material set to subduct along the slab width that has widened up to two and a half times its initial dimension. In nature, it is expected to extend from hundreds to thousands of kilometres depending on the slab--plume buoyancy flux ratio. To our knowledge, this study is the first to highlight the inter-relationships between a plume head and its feeding conditions in the plume source region.},

We determined thermal diffusivity (D) of a suite of 14 greenstone, mafic granulite and tonalite--trondhjemite--granodiorite (TTG) rocks at temperatures up to 1000{$^\circ$}C at atmospheric pressure using laser flash analysis, which lacks systematic errors associated with conventional contact techniques. At room temperature, D ranges from {$\sim$}3.8mm2s-1 for banded iron formation to {$\sim$}0.8mm2s-1 for a quartz-poor trondjhemite. For all samples thermal diffusivity decreases with increasing temperature, such that D for the suite converges around {$\sim$}0.7{\textpm}0.1mm2s-1 at {$\sim$}700{$^\circ$}C. Combining these results with measured density and heat capacity calculated from modal mineralogy provides thermal conductivity as a function of temperature for each rock suite. Whereas near-surface thermal conductivity varies from 2.7 to 4.2Wm-1K-1 depending on rock type, thermal conductivity of the lower crust is {$\sim$}2Wm-1K-1 and only weakly dependent on lithology, which is more thermally resistive than the uppermost mantle ({$\sim$}3.5Wm-1K-1). Use of temperature-dependent thermal transport properties in numerical models reveals that surface geotherms can be relatively insensitive to crustal heat production, because high heat-producing TTG rocks typically have high thermal diffusivity and conductivity at low temperatures and, consequently, are more efficient conductors of the heat they produce. This finding implies that calculations of crustal heat production from surface borehole measurements may entail significant uncertainties.}

  abstract = {In order to better determine the behavior of CO2 relative to incompatible elements, and improve the accuracy of mantle CO2 concentration and flux estimates, we determined CO2 glass and vesicle concentrations, plus trace element contents for fifty-one ultradepleted mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) glasses from the global mid-ocean ridge system. Fifteen contained no vesicles and were volatile undersaturated for their depth of eruption. Thirty-six contained vesicles and/or were slightly oversaturated, and so may not have retained all of their CO2. If this latter group lost some bubbles during emplacement, then CO2/Ba calculated for the undersaturated group alone is the most reliable and uniform ratio at 98{\textpm}10, and CO2/Nb is 283{\textpm}32. If the oversaturated MORBs did not lose bubbles, then CO2/Nb is the most uniform ratio within the entire suite of ultradepleted MORBs at 291{\textpm}132, while CO2/Ba decreases with increasing incompatible element enrichment. Additional constraints on CO2/Ba and CO2/Nb ratios are provided by published estimates of CO2 contents in highly vesicular enriched basalts that may have retained their vesicles e.g., the Mid-Atlantic Ridge "popping rocks", and from olivine-hosted melt inclusions in normal MORBs. As incompatible element enrichment increases, CO2/Nb increases progressively from 283{\textpm}32 in ultradepleted MORBs to 603{\textpm}69 in depleted melt inclusions to 936{\textpm}132 in enriched, vesicular basalts. In contrast, CO2/Ba is nearly uniform in these sample suites at 98{\textpm}10, 106{\textpm}24 and 111{\textpm}11 respectively. This suggests that Ba is the best proxy for estimating CO2 contents of MORBs, with an overall average CO2/Ba=105{\textpm}9. Atlantic, Pacific and Indian basalts have similar values. Gakkel Ridge has lower CO2/Ba because of anomalously high Ba, and is not included in our global averages.Using the CO2/Ba ratio and published compilations of trace elements in average MORBs, the CO2 concentration of a primary, average MORB is 2085+473/-427ppm, while primary NMORB magmas ({\textbackslash}textgreater500km from ocean island hotspots) have 1840ppm CO2. The annual flux of CO2 from mid-ocean ridges is 1.25{\textpm}0.16{\texttimes}1014g/yr, with possible values as low as 0.93 and as high as 1.61{\texttimes}1014g/yr. This amount is equivalent to approximately 0.3\% of the anthropogenic addition of CO2 to Earth's atmosphere. NMORB mantle has 183ppm CO2 (50ppm C) based on simple melting models and 13\% melting. More realistic estimates of incompatible element concentrations in the depleted mantle that are consistent with complex melting models yield much lower estimates for CO2 in the depleted mantle: around 60-130ppm CO2, with large uncertainties that are more related to melting models than to CO2/Ba. CO2/Ba is not correlated with isotopic or trace element ratios, but there may be systematic regional mantle variations. Iceland melt inclusions and Gakkel Ridge MORBs have lower CO2/Ba ratios, showing that these regional high Ba anomalies are not accompanied by correspondingly high CO2 concentrations.},

  abstract = {Temperatures in thick continental lithosphere do not adjust rapidly to secular changes of mantle temperature and in-situ radioactive decay. In the past, enhanced heat production may have led to geotherms that turn over above the base of the lithosphere, such that the lower lithosphere was hotter than, and was losing heat to, the underlying convecting mantle. Lithosphere with a turning geotherm would be unstable, undergoing delamination due to convective shear stresses imparted by the underlying mantle and in-situ partial melting if the lithospheric mantle contains small amounts of water and carbon. Both processes act to stabilize continental roots through reductions of lithospheric thickness and in-situ heat production, and hence may be responsible for the present-day characteristics of those roots that have survived until today. According to these arguments, a stable thermal structure requires that the average heat production rate in the lithospheric mantle does not exceed a critical value which depends on lithosphere thickness. The threshold value of heat production is 0.025????W m - 3 in lithosphere that is thicker than 300??km. Cratonic roots that grow by underplating of oceanic lithosphere in a subduction environment undergo an initial heating phase which may lead to partial melting and to the formation of near-solidus mantle melts without any external heating event involved. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Cratons stabilized in the Archean because their mantle roots remained strong despite temperatures in the convecting mantle and amounts of radiogenic elements in the crust and in the lithospheric mantle that were larger than today. Thermal evolutionary models are developed using constraints from heat flow and heat production data in Archean provinces. The large time-scale of diffusive heat transport implies that the lithospheric mantle can remain thermally decoupled from the crust for as long as 1 Gyr. Heat production in the lithospheric mantle is a key variable in determining thermal conditions that permit stabilization of the crust and the preservation of a thick cratonic mantle root. Archean provinces are currently characterized by low heat flow, with an average of 41mWm-2 less than the global continental average (56 mW m-2). The range of regionally averaged heat flow values in Archean provinces (18--54 mW m-2) is narrower than in Proterozoic and Paleozoic terranes. However, at the end of the Archean, when crustal heat production was double the present value, surface heat flow would have varied over a range ({$\approx$}45--90mWm-2) at least as wide as that presently observed in Paleozoic provinces. The high crustal heat production during the Archean is not sufficient to account for elevated lower crustal temperatures recorded in some metamorphic assemblages without some additional heat input, or without the crust being thicker, or the vertical distribution of radioelements being different from today's. Thermal models and the observed correlation between the degree of upper crustal enrichment and heat production values indicate that crustal melting and differentiation were largely driven by heating due to in- situ radiogenic heat production. Even for values of the surface heat flow higher than average in cratons, the crust can be stabilized before 2.5 Ga if the radioelements are confined to shallow crustal layers. For present surface heat flow of 40--45 mW m-2, calculations indicate that, prior to differentiation, the lowermost crust was near the solidus. Present heat production in the mantle root is constrained by estimates of the mantle heat flow. Further constraints can be obtained by modeling the past thermal regime of the root when heat production was higher. If heat generation is high and/or if the root is thick, the lower lithosphere must have cooled more rapidly than the convecting mantle, which implies that the temperature gradient was inverted at the base of the lithosphere and a weak mechanical layer formed in the middle of the root, precluding its survival. A low temperature gradient at the base of the root leads to the development of convective instabilities and possible removal of the lowermost part. Following its isolation from the convecting mantle and stabilization, thick continental lithosphere adjusts slowly to in-situ heat production and basal heat supply. We show that, due to in-situ heat production, temperatures in the lithospheric mantle may rise above their initial values inherited from the process of root formation due to in-situ radiogenic heat production.},

  abstract = {The initial stage of continental extension between Australia and Antarctica was associated with lateral changes in extension direction along the margin that reflects the three-dimensional nature of strain during continental rifting. In the Cretaceous Otway Basin, this change in extension direction was related to substantial rheological differences in the lithosphere across the boundary between two Paleozoic fold belts, the Lachlan and Delamerian, with the net extension direction at a high angle to this boundary. The initial Early Cretaceous rifting preserved within the onshore Otway Basin has two main structural subdomains in the eastern and western Otway Basins distinguished by different structural trends of Early Cretaceous normal faulting. This is not controlled by a variation in preexisting structural weaknesses within the underlying Paleozoic basement because the same geometry of extensional structures also occurs within the basement to the north irrespective of the preexisting structural grain. The eastern Otway Basin is dominated by NE-striking NW-dipping normal faults. In the western Otway Basin, the faults define arrays of predominantly NE-dipping or SW-dipping faults separated by wide accommodation zones defined by folding and variably striking and dipping faults. The partitioning of strain along the boundary between the eastern and western Otway Basins is accommodated by a progressive change in strike of faults and not via a transfer fault. Younger rifting in the Late Cretaceous had a similar extension direction in the western Otway basin, but had a dominant seaward dip, extension appears to have been hindered in the eastern Otway basin by a Proterozoic/Paleozoic basement feature. These factors produced a region of diverging extension along the lithospheric boundary between the Delamerian and Lachlan Fold Belts that lead to failure along this boundary and the formation of a localized sinistral trans-tensional graben, the Shipwreck trough, in the early Late Cretaceous. As a result, the younger rifting stepped south of the eastern Otway Basin leaving Bass Strait (the strait between the Australian mainland and Tasmania) a failed rift. The formation of oceanic crust in the Mid to Late Eocene followed the boundary of Late Cretaceous rifting, which led to the formation of the Tasman Fracture Zone.},

Direct observations of surface reservoirs allow for the detailed quantification of their carbon content. However, the carbon content of Earth's deep interior remains poorly constrained. Here we study olivine-hosted melt inclusions from two Icelandic eruptions, with those from the Mi{\dh}fell eruption allowing us to investigate the carbon content of the deep mantle. Comparison with the previously studied Borgarhraun eruption highlights the presence of deep, plume-sourced mantle material within the Mi{\dh}fell source region. Mi{\dh}fell contains trace element-depleted melt inclusions undersaturated in CO2, which have high CO2/Ba (=396{\textpm}48) and CO2/Nb (=1832{\textpm}316), though some inclusions preserve even greater relative carbon enrichment. These observations allow us to reconstruct the CO2 content of the bulk Mi{\dh}fell source as being {\textbackslash}textgreater690 ppm. By identifying that Mi{\dh}fell is a mixture of depleted and deep mantle components, we can estimate a CO2 content for the deep mantle component of 1350{\textpm}350 ppm; a concentration that is over ten times higher than depleted MORB mantle estimates. Assuming that the deep mantle component identified in Mi{\dh}fell is representative of a global reservoir, then with our new CO2 estimate and by considering a range of representative mantle fractions for this reservoir, we calculate that it contains up to 14 times more carbon than that of the atmosphere, oceans, and crust combined. Our result of elevated CO2/Ba and CO2/Nb ratios, and carbon enrichment support geochemical bulk Earth carbon models that call for the presence of carbon-rich deep mantle domains to balance Earth's relatively carbon-poor upper mantle and surface environment.}

  abstract = {[1] Plate motions and subducting slab morphology are intricately connected, and through the integration of seismicity, tomographic images, and relative plate motions, the evolution of mantle structure can be interpreted. Tomographic images of P wave, shear wave speed, and bulk sound speed perturbations of the northwest Pacific region have been interpreted to define the extent and geometry of the subducting Pacific plate. We have found that the subducted Pacific plate beneath the Japan and Kurile arcs is coherent but is very complex at the junction of the two arcs near the Hokkaido corner, as the slab subduction angle decreases from north to south while the slab thickens. The Pacific slab beneath the Japan arc is slightly thinner and subducting through the upper mantle at a less steep angle than the slab beneath the Kurile arc. As the slab reaches the 660-km discontinuity it becomes stagnant and lies in a horizontal position on top of the transition zone both beneath the Izu and Japan arcs. In contrast, the slab beneath the Kurile arc is subducting at a steeper angle and penetrates through the transition zone into the lower mantle. The difference in slab morphology appears to be due to a combination of change in dip of the subducting plate and the convergence velocity of the Pacific plate along the margin. A new paleogeographic reconstruction of northeast Asia was assembled to evaluate the plate motions that could explain the foundation of the current slab morphology. The plate reconstruction was based on Euler pole motions of the Pacific, Philippine, Amurian, Okhotsk, and North American plates relative to stable Eurasia plate. The new tectonic model illustrates the collision of the Japan and Kurile arcs, the opening of the Kurile Basin, disparity in Pacific plate velocities along the arc, and different rates of trench retreat along the Izu, Japan, and Kurile segments of the western Pacific margin. The plate motion model was interpreted in conjunction with the physical properties of the mantle imaged with the P wave and joint tomography to assess the evolution of the Pacific plate morphology since the mid-Miocene and to provide constraints on the plausible plate motions in the region.},

  abstract = {The Atlas Mountains of Morocco, an example of an intracontinental mountain belt, display only modest tectonic shortening, yet have unusually high topography. We present new evidence from receiver functions and shear-wave splitting for localized, nearly vertical offset deformation of both crust-mantle and lithosphere-asthenosphere interfaces at the flanks of the High Atlas. These offsets coincide with the locations of Jurassic-aged normal fault reactivation that led to tectonic inversion of the region during the Cenozoic. This suggests that a lithospheric-scale discontinuity is involved in orogeny. Another significant step in lithospheric thickness is inferred within the Middle Atlas. Its location corresponds to the source of regional Quaternary alkali volcanism, where the influx of melt induced by the shallow asthenosphere appears to be restricted to the lithospheric-scale fault on the northern side of the range. Inferred stretching axes from shear-wave splitting are aligned with the highest topography, suggesting along-strike asthenospheric shearing in mantle flow guided by lithospheric topography. Isostatic modeling based on these improved crustal thickness and offset estimates indicates that lithospheric thinning alone does not explain the anomalous Atlas topography. Instead, an upwelling component induced by a hot mantle anomaly is also required to support the Atlas, suggesting that the timing of uplift is contemporaneous with the recent volcanism in the Middle Atlas. These observations provide a refined understanding of intracontinental orogeny and localized volcanism.}

Published models of gravity data that assume normal crust and mantle density predict 5--10-km-thicker crust than we observe, suggesting that the mantle beneath Hikurangi Plateau has anomalously low density, which is inconsistent with previous suggestions of eclogite to explain observations of high seismic velocity. The combination of high seismic velocity and low density requires the mantle to be highly depleted and not serpentinized. We propose that Hikurangi Plateau formed by decompression melting of buoyant mantle that was removed from a craton root by subduction, held beneath 660 km by viscous coupling to slabs, and then rose as a plume from the lower mantle. Ancient Re-Os ages from mantle xenoliths in nearby South Island, New Zealand, support this hypothesis. Erosion of buoyant depleted mantle from craton roots by subduction and then recycling in plumes to make new lithosphere may be an important global geochemical process.}

  abstract = {Dynamic topography is commonly understood to be deflection of the Earth's surface that results from convection of the mantle. Because different authors use the words ``dynamic topography'' differently, topography designated as dynamic may amount to only a few hundred meters or may exceed 2000 m. For most regions, however, surface heights computed on the assumption that the lithospheric column is in isostatic equilibrium provide good approximations to observed topography. The small free-air gravity anomalies and still smaller isostatic anomalies ({$<$}{\textasciitilde}30--50 mGal) associated with long-wavelength topography suggest that deflections of the Earth's surface induced by flow-induced normal tractions applied to the base of the lithosphere do not exceed {\textasciitilde}300 m. Little evidence exists to show that such tractions support more than {\textasciitilde}100 m of high terrain in regions like southern Africa, the Rocky Mountains and Colorado Plateau of the USA, eastern Asia, or the Aegean-Anatolian region, where some have argued for many hundreds to {$>$}2000 m of dynamic topography. Moreover, simple examples show that if flow-induced stresses maintain a given density distribution, then the resultant surface deflections can be smaller than those that would exist in isostatic equilibrium. In light of confusion over the term ``dynamic topography,'' we offer readers simple tools that we hope will enable them to diagnose the component of topography that results from flow-induced stresses and to distinguish it from topography that is compensated isostatically.},

  abstract = {Convective removal of lower lithosphere beneath the Tibetan Plateau can account for a rapid increase in the mean elevation of the Tibetan Plateau of 1000 m or more in a few million years. Such uplift seems to be required by abrupt tectonic and environmental changes in Asia and the Indian Ocean in late Cenozoic time. The composition of basaltic volcanism in northern Tibet, which apparently began at about 13 Ma, implies melting of lithosphere, not asthenosphere. The most plausible mechanism for rapid heat transfer to the midlithosphere is by convective removal of deeper lithosphere and its replacement by hotter asthenosphere. The initiation of normal faulting in Tibet at about 8 ({\textpm} 3) Ma suggests that the plateau underwent an appreciable increase in elevation at that time. An increase due solely to the isostatic response to crustal thickening caused by India's penetration into Eurasia should have been slow and could not have triggered normal faulting. Another process, such as removal of relatively cold, dense lower lithosphere, must have caused a supplemental uplift of the surface. Folding and faulting of the Indo-Australian plate south of India, the most prominent oceanic intraplate deformation on Earth, began between about 7.5 and 8 Ma and indicates an increased north-south compressional stress within the Indo-Australian plate. A Tibetan uplift of only 1000 m, if the result of removal of lower lithosphere, should have increased the compressional stress that the plateau applies to India and that resists India's northward movement, from an amount too small to fold oceanic lithosphere, to one sufficient to do so. The climate of the equatorial Indian Ocean and southern Asia changed at about 6--9 Ma: monsoonal winds apparently strengthened, northern Pakistan became more arid, but weathering of rock in the eastern Himalaya apparently increased. Because of its high altitude and lateral extent, the Tibetan Plateau provides a heat source at midlatitudes that should oppose classical (symmetric) Hadley circulation between the equator and temperate latitudes and that should help to drive an essentially opposite circulation characteristic of summer monsoons. For the simple case of axisymmetric heating (no dependence on longitude) of an atmosphere without dissipation, theoretical analyses by Hou, Lindzen, and Plumb show that an axisymmetric heat source displaced from the equator can drive a much stronger meridianal (monsoonlike) circulation than such a source centered on the equator, but only if heating exceeds a threshold whose level increases with the latitude of the heat source. Because heating of the atmosphere over Tibet should increase monotonically with elevation of the plateau, a modest uplift (1000--2500 m) of Tibet, already of substantial extent and height, might have been sufficient to exceed a threshold necessary for a strong monsoon. The virtual simultaneity of these phenomena suggests that uplift was rapid: approximately 1000 m to 2500 m in a few million years. Moreover, nearly simultaneously with the late Miocene strengthening of the monsoon, the calcite compensation depth in the oceans dropped, plants using the relatively efficient C4 pathway for photosynthesis evolved rapidly, and atmospheric CO2 seems to have decreased, suggesting causal relationships and positive feedbacks among these phenomena. Both a supplemental uplift of the Himalaya, the southern edge of Tibet, and a strengthened monsoon may have accelerated erosion and weathering of silicate rock in the Himalaya that, in turn, enhanced extraction of CO2 from the atmosphere. Thus these correlations offer some support for links between plateau uplift, a downdrawing of CO2 from the atmosphere, and global climate change, as proposed by Raymo, Ruddiman, and Froehlich. Mantle dynamics beneath mountain belts not only may profoundly affect tectonic processes near and far from the belts, but might also play an important role in altering regional and global climates.},

The Interior Penalty Method is employed to construct the DG weak form. For every element, the approximation space for the velocity field is decomposed as direct sum of a solenoidal space and an irrotational space. This allows to split the DG weak form in two uncoupled problems: the first one solves for the velocity and the hybrid pressure (pressure along the mesh edges) and the second one allows the computation of the pressure in the element interior. Furthermore, the introduction of an extra penalty term leads to an alternative DG formulation for the computation of solenoidal velocities with no presence of pressure terms. Pressure can then be computed as a post-process of the velocity solution. Numerical examples demonstrate the applicability of the proposed methodologies. Copyright c 2007 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

This exchange, called submarine groundwater discharge (SGD), is comprised of terrestrial water mixed with sea water that has infiltrated coastal aquifers. The composition of SGD differs from that predicted by simple mixing because biogeochemical reactions in the aquifer modify its chemistry. To emphasize the importance of mixing and chemical reaction, these coastal aquifers are called subterranean estuaries. Geologists recognize this mixing zone as a site of carbonate diagenesis and dolomite formation. Biologists have recognized that terrestrial inputs of nutrients to the coastal ocean may occur through subterranean processes. Further evidence of SGD comes from the distribution of chemical tracers in the coastal ocean. These tracers originate within coastal aquifers and reach the ocean through SGD. Tracer studies reveal that SGD provides globally important fluxes of nutrients, carbon, and metals to coastal waters. {\copyright} 2010 by Annual Reviews.},

These simulations indicate that a cold and thick lithosphere developed as a result of frequent volcanic eruptions that advected surface materials downwards. Declining heat sources over time led to an abrupt transition to plate tectonics. Consistent with model predictions, the geologic record shows rapid volcanic resurfacing, contractional deformation, a low geothermal gradient across the bulk of the lithosphere and a rapid decrease in heat-pipe volcanism after initiation of plate tectonics. The heat-pipe Earth model therefore offers a coherent geodynamic framework in which to explore the evolution of our planet before the onset of plate tectonics.},

We present here the details of a Python implementation of a concise LBM code, with the purpose of offering a pedagogical tool for students and professionals in the geosciences who are approaching this technique for the first time. The first half of the paper focuses on how to vectorize a 2-D LBM code and show how if carefully done, this allows performance close to a compiled code. In the second part of the paper, we use the vectorization described earlier to naturally write a parallel implementation using MPI and test both weak and hard scaling up to 1280 cores. One benchmark, Poiseuille flow and two applications, one on sound wave propagation and another on fluid-flow through a simplified model of a rock matrix are finally shown.},

The notion that the Earth's surface is composed of a small number of slowly but continually-moving `rigid' plates floating on a convecting, fluid interior is now firmly established as the foundational concept of the discipline. And in the last decade, it has become routinely observable thanks to space geodesy (see Figure 1). If the plates can be considered rigid, then they are...},

  abstract = {Skip to Next Section In models of crustal deformation at a scale of a few tens of kilometres, it is appropriate to use a Mohr--Coulomb yield criterion for lithospheric failure based on the idea that frictional slip occurs on whichever one of many randomly oriented planes happens to be favourably oriented with respect to the stress field. The Drucker--Prager yield criterion has very similar characteristics to the Mohr--Coulomb criterion but is more straightforward to implement, particularly in the context of large-scale fluid-mechanical deformation of the coupled system of mantle, lithosphere and crust. As such models become more sophisticated it is important to be able to use whichever failure model is appropriate to a given part of the system. We have therefore developed a way to represent Mohr--Coulomb failure within the mathematical framework used by mantle-convection fluid dynamics codes. The new formulation is based on the conceptual picture of lithospheric failure incorporated in the Anderson model of fault development and reproduces shear band angles predicted by this model. We use an transversely isotropic viscous rheology (a different viscosity for pure shear to that for simple shear) to define a preferred plane for slip to occur given the local stress field. The simple-shear viscosity and the deformation can then be iterated to ensure that the yield criterion is always satisfied. We assume the Boussinesq approximation can be applied in the model -- neglecting any effect of dilatancy on the stress field. An additional criterion is required to ensure that deformation occurs along the plane aligned with maximum shear strain rate rather than the perpendicular plane, which is formally equivalent in any symmetric formulation. We compare the behaviour of this formulation to the Drucker--Prager failure model for two-dimensional (2D) layered brittle--ductile systems. The pattern of shear bands is found to be quite similar from each model, although some differences are seen in the characteristic spacings for `equivalent' values of the material properties. In 3D similar patterns are seen but are modulated by additional 3D structure.},

  abstract = {If the viscosity of subducted lithosphere is described purely by temperature and pressure, it should remain considerably more viscous than the surrounding material as it descends through the upper mantle. Many dynamic models of the long wavelength geoid associated with slabs require an increase in viscosity from the upper to the lower mantle but assume the perturbation to the lateral viscosity structure arising from the slabs themselves can be ignored. Previous studies indicate that strong and localized viscosity variations should have a dramatic influence on the geoid. We present 3D finite element models of the regional geoid of the Western Pacific subduction zones. Slab buoyancies and viscosities are defined using the distribution of seismicity. The geoid is very sensitive to the lateral strength of the slab. Very viscous slabs penetrating a low viscosity mantle generate significant (10--50 m) long wavelength geoid lows: opposite to the geoid high which is observed over slabs. To obtain a geoid high comparable to that observed, the lower mantle viscosity must be 60--200 times greater than the upper mantle viscosity and the slab must be in contact with the lower mantle. These strict requirements suggest that slabs have been weakened and cannot act as stress guides from the deep mantle to the surface.},

  abstract = {Subduction zones become congested when they try to consume buoyant, exotic crust. The accretionary mountain belts (orogens) that form at these convergent plate margins have been the principal sites of lateral continental growth through Earth's history. Modern examples of accretionary margins are the North American Cordilleras and southwest Pacific subduction zones. The geologic record contains abundant accretionary orogens, such as the Tasmanides1, along the eastern margin of the supercontinent Gondwana, and the Alta{\"i}des, which formed on the southern margin of Laurasia2. In modern and ancient examples of long-lived accretionary orogens, the overriding plate is subjected to episodes of crustal extension and back-arc basin development, often related to subduction rollback3 and transient episodes of orogenesis and crustal shortening4,5,6,7, coincident with accretion of exotic crust. Here we present three-dimensional dynamic models that show how accretionary margins evolve from the initial collision, through a period of plate margin instability, to re-establishment of a stable convergent margin. The models illustrate how significant curvature of the orogenic system develops, as well as the mechanism for tectonic escape of the back-arc region. The complexity of the morphology and the evolution of the system are caused by lateral rollback of a tightly arcuate trench migrating parallel to the plate boundary and orthogonally to the convergence direction. We find geological and geophysical evidence for this process in the Tasmanides of eastern Australia, and infer that this is a recurrent and global phenomenon.},

Brittle failure of the lithosphere occurs when stresses are high. In order to build a realistic simulation of the planet's evolution, the complete viscoelastic / brittle convection system needs to be considered. A Lagrangian Integration point finite element method is discussed which can simulate very large deformation viscoelasticity with a strain-dependent yield stress. We also describe the general, parallel implementation of this method (Snark) and compare the performance to a highly optimized, serial prototype code (Ellipsis). The specialized code shows better scaling for a single processor. The parallel scaling of the general code is very flat for ``realistic'' problem sizes indicating efficient use of multiple processors.},

I have shown3 that the Hawaiian-Emperor, Tuamotu-Line and Austral-Gilbert-Marshall island chains can be generated by the motion of a rigid Pacific plate rotating over three fixed hotspots. The motion deduced for the Pacific plate agrees with the palaeomagnetic studies of seamounts4. It has also been found that the relative plate motions deduced from fault strikes and spreading rates agree with the concept of rigid plates moving over fixed hotspots. Fig. 1 shows the absolute motion of the plates over the mantle, a synthesis which satisfies the relative motion data and quite accurately predicts the trends of the island chains and aseismic ridges away from hotspots. {\copyright} 1971 Nature Publishing Group.}

We statistically assess that almost all arcs on the Earth can be described by these hypotheses.

  abstract = {Motivated by recent attenuation experiments on finely grained samples, we reanalyse the Raj--Ashby model of grain-boundary sliding. Two linearly elastic layers having finite thickness and identical elastic constants are separated by an interface (grain boundary) whose location is a given periodic function of position. Dissipation is confined to that interfacial region. It is caused by two mechanisms: a slip (boundary sliding) viscosity, and grain-boundary diffusion, with corresponding Maxwell relaxation times tv and td. Owing to the assumption of a given, time-independent interface, the resulting boundary-value problem (b.v.p.) is linear and time-separable. The response to time-periodic forcing depends on angular frequency \${\o}mega\$, on the ratio M=tv/td of Maxwell times, and on the characteristic interface slope. The b.v.p. is solved using a perturbation method valid for small slopes. To relate features of the mechanical loss spectrum previously studied in isolation, we first discuss the solution as a function of M. Motivated by experiments, we then emphasize the case M{$\ll$}1 in which the relaxation times are widely separated. The loss spectrum then always has two major features: a frequency band 1{$\ll\$$}{\o}mega\$td{$\ll$}M-1 within which the loss varies relatively weakly with \${\o}mega\$; and a loss maximum at \${\o}mega\$td{$\sim$}M-1 due to the slip viscosity. If corners on the interface are sufficiently rounded, those two universal features are separated by a third feature: between them, there is a strong minimum whose location is (entirely) independent of slip viscosity. The existence of that minimum has not previously been reported. These features are likely to occur even in solutions for finite interface slopes, because they are a consequence of the separation of timescales. The precise form of the spectrum in the weakly varying band must, however, be slope-dependent because it is controlled by stress singularities occurring at corners, and the strength of those singularities depends on the angle subtended by the corner.},

Using existing measurements of {$\eta$} and Q obtained respectively from uniaxial creep tests, and forced torsional oscillation tests, we test that prediction.

Altered lavas and limestones were dredged from three volcanoes during the 2015 Volcanic Evolution of South Pacific Arcs cruise of N/O l'Atalante, so a total of four, including the northernmost and southernmost, have now been directly sampled and analysed. Dating of lava and volcanic breccia clasts by Ar--Ar methods gives north-to-south ages from these sites of 31.3 {\textpm} 0.6, 33 {\textpm} 5, 21.5 {\textpm} 1.0 and 26.3 {\textpm} 0.1 Ma. These ages, along with supporting stratigraphic data on a fifth seamount from IODP borehole U1507, provisionally refute the hypotheses that the seamounts represent a southward-younging, age-progressive, intraplate volcanic chain on the Australian Plate or a subduction-related chain of restricted age range. Geochemically, the upper Eocene to lower Miocene lavas have alkaline and subalkaline basaltic compositions, and some could be shoshonitic. The location of the volcanoes along the western side of the Norfolk Ridge suggests an origin related to late Eocene and early Miocene melting near an intracontinental lithosphere--asthenosphere step. Involvement of a deep slab in petrogenesis is also possible.KEY POINTS Eight seamounts form a line along the Norfolk Ridge. Dating and geochemistry indicate the seamount line is not a hotspot track. A rift-related origin, possibly with influence by subduction, is proposed.},

The region has elevated bathymetry relative to surrounding oceanic crust, diverse and silica-rich rocks, and relatively thick and low-velocity crustal structure. Its isolation from Australia and large area support its definition as a continent- Zealandia. Zealandia was formerly part of Gondwana. Today it is 94\% submerged, mainly as a result of widespread Late Cretaceous crustal thinning preceding supercontinent breakup and consequent isostatic balance. The identification of Zealandia as a geological continent, rather than a collection of continental islands, fragments, and slices, more correctly represents the geology of this part of Earth. Zealandia provides a fresh context in which to investigate processes of continental rifting, thinning, and breakup.}

We derived a 2D Poisson's ratio distribution from P- and S-wave seismic wide angle data collected in the trench-outer rise. High values of Poisson's ratio in the uppermost mantle suggest that the oceanic lithosphere is highly hydrated due to the water infiltration through bending-related normal faults outcropping at the seafloor. This process is presumably facilitated by the presence of a seamount in the area. We conclude that water infiltrates deep into the lithosphere, when it approaches the Chile trench, producing a reduction of crustal and upper mantle velocities, supporting serpentinization of the upper mantle. Further, we observed a mantle Vp anisotropy of 8\%, with the fast velocity axis running normal to the abyssal hill fabric and hence in spreading direction, indicating that outer rise processes have yet not affected anisotropy.The first weeks following the megatrust Mw = 8.8 Maule earthquake in 2010 were characterized by a sudden increase of the outer rise seismic activity, located between 34{$^\circ$} S and 35{$^\circ$}30' S. We concluded that this phenomenon is a result of an intensification of the water infiltration process in the outer rise, presumably triggered by the main shock, whose epicenter was located some 100 km to the south east of the cluster.},

We show that our model outperforms previous deep-learning and traditional phase-picking and detection algorithms. Applying our model to 5 weeks of continuous data recorded during 2000 Tottori earthquakes in Japan, we were able to detect and locate two times more earthquakes using only a portion (less than 1/3) of seismic stations.

The global HM sands industry remains dominated by Australia, which until the mid-1990s included the export of monazite concentrates for REE extraction and provided {$\sim$}15--30\% of world REE production. The lack of recognition for HM sands as a potential REE resource adds to confusion about potential REE supplies. This study presents a comprehensive assessment of Australian HM sand resources, including an assessment of likely contained monazite, showing that these REE can potentially double the value of a HM sand project. As such, there remains significant opportunities for HM sands projects to increase their economic value by also extracting monazite and xenotime for their REE, with further research needed to assess environmental and radioactivity issues.},

  abstract = {The paper presents a theory for modeling flow in anisotropic, viscous rock. This theory has originally been developed for the simulation of large deformation processes including the folding and kinking of multi-layered visco-elastic rock (Mu{\textasciidieresis}hlhaus et al. [1,2]). The orientation of slip planes in the context of crystallographic slip is determined by the normal vector -- the director -- of these surfaces. The model is applied to simulate anisotropic mantle convection. We compare the evolution of flow patterns, Nusselt number and director orientations for isotropic and anisotropic rheologies. In the simulations we utilize two different finite element methodologies: The Lagrangian Integration Point Method Moresi et al [8] and an Eulerian formulation, which we implemented into the finite element based pde solver Fastflo (www.cmis.csiro.au/Fastflo/). The reason for utilizing two different finite element codes was firstly to study the influence of an anisotropic power law rheology which currently is not implemented into the Lagrangian Integration point scheme [8]and secondly to study the numerical performance of Eulerian (Fastflo)- and Lagrangian integration schemes [8]. It turned out that whereas in the Lagrangian method the Nusselt number vs time plot reached only a quasi steady state where the Nusselt number oscillates around a steady state value the Eulerian scheme reaches exact steady states and produces a high degree of alignment (director orientation locally orthogonal to velocity vector almost everywhere in the computational domain). In the simulations emergent anisotropy was strongest in terms of modulus contrast in the up and down-welling plumes. Mechanisms for anisotropic material behavior in the mantle dynamics context are discussed by Christensen [3]. The dominant mineral phases in the mantle generally do not exhibit strong elastic anisotropy but they still may be oriented by the convective flow. Thus viscous anisotropy (the main focus of this paper) may or may not correlate with elastic or seismic anisotropy.},

The refinements consist in the inclusion of incremental elasticity, plasticity (yielding) and multiple simultaneous creep mechanisms in addition to the usual visco-plastic models employed in the context of unified plate-mantle models. The main emphasis of this paper rests on the constitutive and computational formulation of the model. We apply a consistent incremental formulation of the non-linear governing equations avoiding the computationally expensive iterations that are otherwise necessary to handle the onset of plastic yield. In connection with episodic convection simulations, we point out the strong dependency of the results on the choice of the initial temperature distribution. Our results also indicate that the inclusion of elasticity in the constitutive relationships lowers the mechanical energy associated with subduction events.},

  abstract = {--- A novel class of nonlinear, visco-elastic rheologies has recently been developed by M{\"U}HLHAUS et al.(2002a, b). The theory was originally developed for the simulation of large deformation processes including folding and kinking in multi-layered visco-elastic rock . The orientation of the layer surfaces or slip planes in the context of crystallographic slip is determined by the normal vector the so-called director of these surfaces. Here the model (M{\"U}HLHAUS et al., 2002a, b) is generalized to include thermal effects; it is shown that in 2-D steady states the director is given by the gradient of the flow potential. The model is applied to anisotropic simple shear where the directors are initially parallel to the shear direction. The relative effects of textural hardening and thermal softening are demonstrated. We then turn to natural convection and compare the time evolution and approximately steady states of isotropic and anisotropic convection for a Rayleigh number Ra=5.64{\texttimes}105 for aspect ratios of the experimental domain of 1 and 2, respectively. The isotropic case has a simple steady-state solution, whereas in the orthotropic convection model patterns evolve continuously in the core of the convection cell, which makes only a near-steady condition possible. This near-steady state condition shows well aligned boundary layers, and the number of convection cells which develop appears to be reduced in the orthotropic case. At the moderate Rayleigh numbers explored here we found only minor influences in the change from aspect ratio one to two in the model domain.},

The dilatancy is caused by micro-cracking associated with the loss of cohesion at the onset of flow and/or the transition of the granulate into a more mobile, more loose packing order. The material behavior is modelled as a non-Newtonian fluid including rigid plastic behavior as a limit case. A rate dependent cohesion term considers the fluid like behavior if collisions dominate the intergranular momentum transfer. The simulations are based on an implicit particle-in-cell finite element code [1] developed by the second author. The implementation of the model equations is benchmarked against an analytical solution for gravity driven flow in an infinite chute.},

  abstract = {Passive margin highlands occur on most continents on Earth and play a critical role in the cycle of weathering, erosion, and atmospheric circulation. Yet, in contrast to the well-developed understanding of collisional mountain belts, such as the Alps and Himalayas, the origin of less elevated (1-2 km) passive margin highlands is still unknown. The eastern Australian highlands are a prime example of these plateaus, but compared to others they have a well-documented episodic uplift history spanning 120 million years. We use a series of mantle convection models to show that the time-dependent interaction of plate motion with mantle downwellings and upwellings accounts for the broad pattern of margin uplift phases. Initial dynamic uplift of 400-600 m from 120-80 Ma was driven by the eastward motion of eastern Australia's margin away from the sinking eastern Gondwana slab, followed by tectonic quiescence to about 60 Ma in the south (Snowy Mountains). Renewed uplift of {$\sim$}700 m in the Snowy Mountains is propelled by the gradual motion of the margin over the edge of the large Pacific mantle upwelling. In contrast the northernmost portion of the highlands records continuous uplift from 120 Ma to present-day totalling about 800 m. The northern highlands experienced a continuous history of dynamic uplift, first due to the end of subduction to the east of Australia, then due to moving over a large passive mantle upwelling. In contrast, the southern highlands started interacting with the edge of the large Pacific mantle upwelling {$\sim$}40-50 million years later, resulting in a two-phase uplift history. Our results are in agreement with published uplift models derived from river profiles and the Cretaceous sediment influx into the Ceduna sub-basin offshore southeast Australia, reflecting the fundamental link between dynamic uplift, fluvial erosion and depositional pulses in basins distal to passive margin highlands.},

Periodicities of 26 to 30 My occur in diverse geological phenomena including mass extinctions, flood basalt volcanism, ocean anoxic events, deposition of massive evaporites, sequence boundaries, and orogenic events and have previously been linked to an extraterrestrial mechanism. The vast oceanic crustal carbon reservoir is an alternative potential driving force of climate fluctuations at these time scales, with hydrothermal crustal carbon uptake occurring mostly in young crust with a strong dependence on ocean bottom water temperature. We combine a global plate model and oceanic paleo-age grids with estimates of paleo-ocean bottom water temperatures to track the evolution of the oceanic crustal carbon reservoir over the past 230 My. We show that seafloor spreading rates as well as the storage, subduction, and emission of oceanic crustal and mantle CO2 fluctuate with a period of 26 My. A connection with seafloor spreading rates and equivalent cycles in subduction zone rollback suggests that these periodicities are driven by the dynamics of subduction zone migration. The oceanic crust-mantle carbon cycle is thus a previously overlooked mechanism that connects plate tectonic pulsing with fluctuations in atmospheric carbon and surface environments.}

  abstract = {One major cause of elastic wave attenuation in heterogeneous porous media is wave-induced flow of the pore fluid between heterogeneities of various scales. It is believed that for frequencies below 1kHz , the most important cause is the wave-induced flow between mesoscopic inhomogeneities, which are large compared with the typical individual pore size but small compared to the wavelength. Various laboratory experiments in some natural porous materials provide evidence for the presence of centimeter-scale mesoscopic heterogeneities. Laboratory and field measurements of seismic attenuation in fluid-saturated rocks provide indications of the role of the wave-induced flow. Signatures of wave-induced flow include the frequency and saturation dependence of P-wave attenuation and its associated velocity dispersion, frequency-dependent shear-wave splitting, and attenuation anisotropy. During the last four decades, numerous models for attenuation and velocity dispersion from wave-induced flow have been developed with varying degrees of rigor and complexity. These models can be categorized roughly into three groups ac-cording to their underlying theoretical framework. The first group of models is based on Biot's theory of poroelasticity. The second group is based on elastodynamic theory where local fluid flow is incorporated through an additional hydrodynamic equation. Another group of models is derived using the theory of viscoelasticity. Though all models predict attenuation and velocity dispersion typical for a relaxation process, there exist differences that can be related to the type of disorder (periodic, random, space dimension) and to the way the local flow is incorporated. The differences manifest themselves in different asymptotic scaling laws for attenuation and in different expressions for characteristic frequencies. In recent years, some theoretical models of wave-induced fluid flow have been validated numerically, using finite-difference, finite-element, and reflectivity algorithms applied to Biot's equations of poroelasticity. Application of theoretical models to real seismic data requires further studies using broadband laboratory and field measurements of attenuation and dispersion for different rocks as well as development of more robust methods for estimating dissipation attributes from field data.

  abstract = {In recent years, two end-member models for the formation of supercontinents have emerged. In the classical Wilson cycle, oceanic crust generated during supercontinent breakup (the interior ocean) is consumed during subsequent amalgamation so that the supercontinent turns "inside in" (introversion). Alternatively, following supercontinent breakup, the exterior margins of the dispersing continental fragments collide during reassembly so that the supercontinent turns "outside in" (extroversion). These end-member models can be distinguished by comparing the Sm-Nd crust-formation ages of accreted mafic complexes (e.g., ophiolites) in the collisional orogens formed during supercontinent assembly with the breakup age of the previous supercontinent. For supercontinents generated by introversion, these crust-formation ages postdate rifting of the previous supercontinent. For supercontinents generated by extroversion, the oceanic lithosphere consumed during reassembly predates breakup of the previous supercontinent, so that crust-formation ages of accreted mafic complexes are older than the age of rifting. In the Paleozoic Appalachian-Caledonide-Variscan orogen, a key collisional orogen in the assembly of Pangea, crust-formation ages of accretionary mafic complexes postdate the formation of the Iapetus Ocean (i.e., are younger than ca. 0.6 Ga), suggesting supercontinent reassembly by introversion. By contrast, the Neoproterozoic East African and Brasiliano orogens, which formed during the amalgamation of Gondwana, are characterized by mafic complexes with crust-formation ages (ca. 0.75-1.2 Ga) that predate the ca. 750 Ma breakup of Rodinia. Hence, these complexes must have formed from lithosphere in the exterior ocean that surrounded Rodinia, implying that this ocean was consumed during the amalgamation of Gondwana. These data indicate that Pangea and Gondwana were formed by introversion and extroversion, respectively, implying that supercontinents can be assembled by fundamentally distinct geodynamic processes.},

  abstract = {We have shown in a previous paper that many of the main features of braided streams can be captured in a relatively simple cellular computer model. Here we examine some of the detailed characteristics of this model. We show the qualitative form of the braiding produced by the model is generally insensitive to changes in most of the numerical parameters used in the model. The most crucial parameter choice is the use of a non-linear exponent ({\textbackslash}textgreater1) to describe the relation between sediment flux and local stream power. Use of water discharge instead of stream power to parameterize sediment flux produces braiding, but also unrealistically high-amplitude topography variations in the long term. Introduction of a threshold transport condition causes no noticeable change in the model's behaviour. Inclusion of lateral sediment transport due to gravitational effects on lateral slopes is not crucial to produce braiding, but is needed to provide reasonable lateral channel shifting, and to maintain a continuing dynamic behaviour. As long as lateral sediment transport is included, altering the initial topography for a run has no effect, other than a transient period of regrading. In addition, we show that there is a simple and apparently fundamental connection between braided-stream channel networks and erosional (dendritic) networks that has not been previously recognized. All that is needed to switch the model from braided to dendritic patterns is either to remove redeposition from the rules, simulating entrainment of cohesive sediment, or to add a cliff to the initial topography, making local redeposition unimportant. This result suggests that the presence or absence of significant local redeposition, which causes bar formation, channel division, and avulsion, determines whether a braided or dendritic pattern will form.

  abstract = {We explore the conductive cooling rates of plutons and temperature-time paths of their wall rocks using numerical methods that explicitly account for the temperature dependence of thermal diffusivity ({$\alpha$}) and heat capacity (CP). We focus on {$\alpha$} because it has the strongest influence on the temperature-dependence of thermal conductivity (k={$\rho\cdot$}CP{$\cdot\alpha$}) at high temperatures. Latent heats of crystallization are incorporated into the models as apparent CP's. Two sets of models are presented, one for a 50m thick basalt sill emplaced into rocks with diffusivity of the average crust, and one for a 5km wide and 2km thick granite pluton emplaced into dolostones. The sill's liquidus is 1230{$^\circ$}C, the solidus 980{$^\circ$}C, and the sill is emplaced into wall rocks that are at 150{$^\circ$}C. The pluton's liquidus is 900{$^\circ$}C, the solidus 680{$^\circ$}C, and the pluton is emplaced into wall rocks with initial geothermal gradient of 30{$^\circ$}C/km. The top of the pluton is at 3km depth. Incorporating appropriate {$\alpha$}=f(T) into calculations can more than double the solidification times of intrusions in comparison with incorporating constant {$\alpha$} of 1mm2{$\cdot$}s-1 that is used in most petrologic heat transport models. The instantaneously emplaced basalt sill takes {$\sim$}51a to completely solidify, whereas the granite pluton takes {$\sim$}52ka to completely solidify. The solidification time is longer because of low thermal diffusivity of magma and because wall rocks become more insulating as temperature rises. In contact aureoles, maximum temperatures reached with {$\alpha$}=f(T) are somewhat lower in comparison with {$\alpha$}=1mm2{$\cdot$}s-1; however, temperatures in inner aureoles stay elevated significantly longer with {$\alpha$}=f(T), and consequently promote approach to mineralogical and textural equilibrium. The elevated temperature regime in inner aureoles enhances temperature gradients that may promote greater fluid fluxes if fluid pore pressures are controlled by temperatures. The results demonstrate the need to incorporate temperature-dependent transport properties of magmas and wall rocks into models of metamorphism and fluid flow in contact aureoles.},

First, corner frequencies of earthquakes are determined using the spectral-ratio method for S-coda waves. Then, whole-path attenuation terms, t*, and site-amplification factors are simultaneously estimated by a joint inversion. The set of t* is finally inverted for 3-D attenuation structure. The results show that the mantle wedge has low attenuation in the fore arc and high attenuation in the back arc. A depth profile of Q(p)(-1) in the back-arc mantle is explained by attenuation expected for a two-dimensional (2-D) thermal model with Q(p)/Q(s)=2 and grain sizes of 1 and 3 cm. However, an inclined high-attenuation zone observed in the back-arc mantle wedge, which is interpreted as an upwelling flow, shows higher attenuation than that calculated from the 2-D thermal model. The higher seismic attenuation is probably caused by the concentration of partial melt in the upwelling flow. A combined interpretation of seismic attenuation and velocity structures further suggests that the degree of partial melt in the upwelling flow varies along the arc and that volcanoes are clustered transverse to the arc, below which the upwelling flow contains a higher degree of melt. These observations indicate that magmatism is controlled by a mantle-wedge process that depends strongly on spatial variations in the degree of partial melt in the upwelling flow. Our results further imply the breakdown of hydrous minerals in a hydrous layer above the Pacific plate at a depth of similar to 120 km.},

A key to its usefulness is that Hamiltonian dynamics preserves volume, and its trajectories can thus be used to define complex mappings without the need to account for a hard to compute Jacobian factor - a property that can be exactly maintained even when the dynamics is approximated by discretizing time. In this review, discuss theoretical and practical aspects of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, and present some of its variations, including using windows of states for approximations, tempering during the course of a trajectory to handle isolated modes, and short-cut methods that prevent useless trajectories form taking much computation time.},

Here we combine new Hf isotope data with previous Nd-Pb isotope measurements to assess the coupled, time-integrated Hf-Nd-Pb isotope evolution of the most extreme HIMU location (Mangaia, French Polynesia). In comparison with global MORB and other OIB types, Mangaia samples define a unique trend in coupled Hf-Nd-Pb isotope co-variations (expressed in 207Pb/206Pb vs. {$\delta\epsilon$}Hf). In a model employing subducted, dehydrated oceanic crust, mixing between present-day depleted MORB mantle (DMM) and small proportions ({$\sim$}5\%) of a HIMU mantle endmember can re-produce the Hf-Nd-Pb isotope systematics of global HIMU basalts (sensu stricto; i.e., without EM-1/EM-2/FOZO components). An age range of 3.5 to {\textbackslash}textless2Ga is required for HIMU endmember(s) that mix with DMM to account for the observed present-day HIMU isotope compositions, suggesting a range of age distributions rather than a single component in the mantle. Our data suggest that mixing of HIMU mantle endmembers and DMM occurs in the mantle transition zone by entrainment in secondary plumes that rise at the edge of the Pacific Large Low Seismic Velocity Zone (LLSVP). These create either pure HIMU (sensu stricto) or HIMU affected by other enriched mantle endmembers (sensu lato). If correct, this requires isolation of parts of the mantle transition zone for {\textbackslash}textgreater3 Gyr and implies that OIB chemistry can be used to test geodynamic models. {\copyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.}

  abstract = {Tectonic plate geometry organises the planform of convection in the Earth's mantle and is therefore expected to strongly influence mantle upwelling dynamics. We present the findings from two- and three-dimensional mantle convection simulations with plate-like surface motion and analyse how convective patterns and time-dependence change as surface plate geometry is transformed from a simple configuration permitted in 2D experiments (allowing only divergent and convergent plate boundaries) into arrangements requiring three-dimensional modelling. Our experiments model vigorous convection (Ra=10 (super 7) based on the upper mantle viscosity) in a stratified viscosity system featuring both internal and basal heating. We first consider a suite of two-dimensional experiments and determine an estimate for a uniform surface velocity that is comparable in magnitude to the mean transit time for the upwellings associated with the system. We argue that a surface velocity that neither forces nor resists the convectively driven flow meets this requirement but show that temporally varying and constant plate velocities can both satisfy this condition over a given period of time with different results. For the partially internally heated, aspect ratio 4 cases considered here, we choose a fixed velocity boundary condition and find this velocity is about 23\% lower than the mean velocity obtained with a free-slip surface condition in an otherwise identical model. The plate velocity obtained from our two-dimensional experiments is then adopted for our three-dimensional calculations that include plates as plate geometry is systematically varied. For the parameters specified in our study (which result in a basal heat flux of approximately 50\% the surface value and a viscosity contrast of a factor of 30 between the upper and lower mantle) steady plume-like upwellings are present in both free-slip and rigid surface calculations. However, a surface boundary condition featuring a pair of congruent plates moving in opposing directions with a velocity comparable to the plume transit time forces the convective planform into a roll-like pattern featuring essentially sheet-like upwellings positioned below the divergent plate boundary. When plate geometries are specified in a way that produces offset segments of convergent and divergent boundary joined by boundaries characterised by strike-slip motion, the planform of the underlying convection organises into patterns featuring columnar, plume-like, upwellings. Using calculations of upwelling advective heat flux to determine plume locations, we track plume motion in the upper and lower mantle over periods of several plume rise times. We show that long-lived, nearly stationary, plumes appear in calculations featuring surface velocities comparable to the mean vertical velocity of the upwellings and that the associated plume heads remain positioned below intraplate positions for periods that can exceed tens of millions of years.},

An earthquake is simulated by prescribing slip on a fault plane in the mesh and the model relaxes under the resulting change in stress. Both linear Maxwell and biviscous (Burgers) rheological models have been implemented and the model can be easily adapted to include different rheological models and lateral variations in Earth structure, a particular advantage over existing models. We benchmark the model against an analytical 15 coseismic solution and an existing open-source postseismic model, demonstrating good agreement for all fault geometries tested. Due to the inclusion of self-gravity the model has the potential for predicting deformation in response to multiple sources of stress change, for example, changing ice thickness in tectonically active regions.},

  abstract = {Previous studies of heat flow from Precambrian terrains have yielded two different relationships: a global temporal relationship between heat flow and tectonic age, and a regional spatial relationship between heat flow and the proximity of Archean cratons. We analyze heat flow from tectonically stable Precambrian terrains worldwide to address questions associated with these two heat flow patterns: (1) Is the spatial relationship a global pattern? (2) Do the two heat flow relationships have a common underpinning? In answer to the first question, our data analysis reveals a widespread spatial pattern between heat flow and the proximity of Archean cratons, which is characterized by low heat flow in Archean cratons and Proterozoic terrains adjacent to cratonic margins and higher heat flow in Proterozoic terrains that are more than a few hundred kilometers from a craton. To address the second question, we examine three previous interpretative models of Precambrian heat flow: (1) simple cooling of a thermal boundary layer, (2) thicker lithosphere in Archean terrains than in Proterozoic, and (3) greater heat production in Proterozoic crust than in Archean. Model 1 predicts essentially no change in heat flow in terrains older than 1.5 Ga and therefore does not likely provide a common underpinning for the Precambrian heat flow patterns. Models 2 and 3, when combined with the special structural configuration of sutures, can independently yield both the spatial and temporal heat flow distributions and thus alone or together may be considered candidates to explain the Precambrian heat flow patterns. However, thermal models of the lithosphere in which the heat flow patterns are explained entirely by variations in crustal heat production cannot satisfy constraints on upper mantle temperatures beneath Archean cratons derived from xenolith thermobarometry. The thermobarometry constraints can be satisfied by models in which differences in lithospheric thickness are the principal factor controlling the surface heat flow distributions. If the heat flow patterns result primarily from variations in lithospheric thickness, then a different temporal heat flow relationship for Precambrian terrains can be proposed, one in which heat flow varies inversely with the age of stabilization of the lithosphere.},

  abstract = {Studies of heat flow from Precambrian terrains have demonstrated three empirical relationships; a temporal relationship between heat flow and tectonic age, a spatial pattern between heat flow and the proximity of Archean cratons, and a temporal relationship between heat flow and the age of lithosphere stabilization. In the first relationship, heat flow is inversely related to tectonic age. The second pattern is characterized by low heat flow from Archean cratons and Proterozoic terrains adjacent to cratonic margins (pericratonic terrains), and higher heat flow from Proterozoic terrains that are more than a few hundred kilometers from a craton. In the third pattern, heat flow decreases as the age of stabilization of the lithosphere increases. A number of interpretations of Precambrian heat flow have been offered to explain one or more of these relationships. The simple cooling of a thermal boundary layer predicts essentially no change in heat flow in terrains older than approximately 1.5 Ga, and therefore does not likely provide a comprehensive framework for the interpretation of Precambrian heat flow. By contrast, two other interpretations, (1) thicker lithosphere beneath Archean terrains than beneath Proterozoic terrains, and (2) greater heat production in Proterozoic crust than in Archean crust, when combined with the special structural configuration of sutures, can both contribute to the spatial and temporal heat flow distributions. Xenolith thermobarometry constraints on lithospheric temperatures, however, limit the contribution of age-dependent crustal heat production, and therefore at least part of the heat flow distributions derive from variations in lithosphere thickness.},

Limerick, have enabled environmental change, including estimates of summer temperature (ST), to be reconstructed for the Late-glacial period. The sequence opens with fine, partially laminated silt/clay that has varve-like microstructure. A cold steppic environment from the final phase of the pleniglacial is represented here. It is estimated to span almost 2000 years (ca. 16.9-15 cal. ka B.P.; ca. 14.6-12.7 ka B.P.). Substantial development of woody vegetation is limited to the early part of the Late-glacial interstadial (cf. Bolling). This consists mainly of juniper and birch, including tree birch (Betula pubescens), as well as herb-dominated communities. These developments in vegetation and also the evidence from a variety of other proxies, including stable-isotope records (??18O and ??13C), show that the thermal maximum was achieved early in the interstadial but ST probably did not exceeded 14??C. Within this relatively warm period, the various biological, chemical and physical proxies suggest at least one substantial but short-lived climatic oscillation. The later part of the Bolling/Allerod interstadial (after ca. 14 cal. ka B.P.; ca. 12 ka B.P.) began with a considerable and more or less sustained fall in temperature. The low temperature regime was maintained until immediately before the Younger Dryas when a modest but distinct amelioration is recorded by all proxies. This feature, referred to as a 'pre-Younger Dryas warming' (pYDw) and which is seen in land, ocean and Greenland ice-core records from the northeast Atlantic region, has not been previously highlighted in the literature. The Younger Dryas stadial, when ST may have fallen to ca. 6??C, has a distinctive pollen assemblage characterised mainly by Gramineae, Thalictrum and Artemisia, but, for reasons not readily explainable, the early part of the stadial is not well defined in the stable-isotope record. As in most records from the northeast Atlantic region, the transition to the Holocene is sharp and clearly recorded. The importance of Juniperus in the Irish Late-glacial record, as an indicator of temperature change, is discussed and also the possible role played by Ephedra and Secale species at Tory Hill. The apparent absence of temperature gradients within Ireland is commented on, and the evidence for much lower ST in Ireland compared with Great Britain is discussed.},

Although it has been established that ancient Caledonian signatures pervade the lithosphere, tertiary structure related to the Iceland plume has been inferred to dominate the asthenosphere. To address this apparent contradiction in the literature, we image the 3-D lithospheric and deeper upper-mantle structure beneath Ireland via non-linear, iterative joint teleseismic-gravity inversion using data from the ISLE (Irish Seismic Lithospheric Experiment), ISUME (Irish Seismic Upper Mantle Experiment) and GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) experiments. The inversion combines teleseismic relative arrival time residuals with the GRACE long wavelength satellite derived gravity anomaly by assuming a depth-dependent quasilinear velocity-density relationship. We argue that anomalies imaged at lithospheric depths probably reflect compositional contrasts, either due to terrane accretion associated with Iapetus Ocean closure, frozen decompressional melt that was generated by plate stretching during the opening of the north Atlantic Ocean, frozen Iceland plume related magmatic intrusions, or a combination thereof. The continuation of the anomalous structure across the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary is interpreted as possibly reflecting sub-lithospheric small-scale convection initiated by the lithospheric compositional contrasts. Our hypothesis thus reconciles the disparity which exists between lithospheric and asthenospheric structure beneath this region of the north Atlantic rifted margin.},

Shetland dunites have more variable initial187Os/188Os, as well as absolute and relative abundances of the HSE, compared to spatially associated harzburgites. As is common for ophiolitic peridotites, the harzburgites ({$\gamma$}Os492Maof -5.3 to +2.6) preserve evidence for a Mesoproterozoic depletion event, but are dominated by contemporary chondritic, ambient upper mantle compositions. The dunites have {$\gamma$}Os492Mavalues ranging between -3.3 and +12.4, reflecting dunite formation by higher degrees of melt interaction with mantle rock than for the spatially associated harzburgites. Chromitite seams from three locations separated by {\textbackslash}textless500m have a large range in HSE concentrations (e.g., 0.09 to {$\sim$}2.9{$\mu$}gg-1Os) with initial {$\gamma$}Os492Mavalues ranging only from +0.48 to +3.95. Sulphides, arsenides and platinum-group minerals are the primary hosts for the HSE in the chromitites. Their isotopic variations reflect initial isotopic heterogeneity in their primary magmatic signatures. Coupled with field observations that support chromitite formation in concentrated zones of enhanced melt flow, the isotopic dichotomy between the harzburgites and the chromitites suggests that chromitite187Os/188Os compositions may better approximate the upper limit, rather than an average value, of the bulk convecting upper mantle. The Shetland peridotite compositions reflect protracted melt depletion (low-Al2O3) and melt percolation events in a supra-subduction zone (SSZ) setting at {$\sim$}492Ma, following an earlier (Mesoproterozoic) melt-depletion event. These results provide further evidence that ancient chemical complexities can be preserved in the upper mantle during ocean plate formation. Chromitites and peridotites from the Shetland Ophiolite Complex also attest to lithological and geochemical heterogeneities generated at scales of less than tens of metres during the formation of ancient oceanic lithosphere by high-degree SSZ melt extraction, percolation and during chromitite formation in the oceanic lithosphere. {\copyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

To assess the preservation of compositional heterogeneities at sub-metre length-scales in the oceanic mantle, a {$\sim$}45 m2area of the SOC mantle section was mapped and sampled in detail. Harzburgites, dunites and a pyroxenite from this area were analysed for lithophile and highly-siderophile element (HSE) abundances, as well as for187Os/188Os ratios. Lithophile element data for most rocks are characteristic of supra-subduction zone (SSZ) metasomatic processes. Two dunites have moderately fractionated HSE patterns and suprachondritic {$\gamma$}Os(492 Ma)values (+5.1 and +7.5) that are also typical of ophiolitic dunites generated by SSZ melt--rock interactions. By contrast, six harzburgites and four dunites have approximately chondritic-relative abundances of Os, Ir and Ru, and {$\gamma$}Os(492 Ma)values ranging only from -0.6 to +2.7; characteristics that imply no significant influence during SSZ processes. Two harzburgites are also characterised by significantly less radiogenic {$\gamma$}Os(492 Ma)values (-3.5 and -4), and yield Mesoproterozoic time of Re depletion (TRD) model ages. The range of Os isotope compositions in the studied area is comparable to the range reported for a suite of samples representative of the entire SOC mantle section, and approaches the total isotopic variation of the oceanic mantle, as observed in abyssal peridotites. Mechanisms by which this heterogeneity can be formed and preserved involve inefficient and temporally distinct melt extraction events and strong localised channelling of these melts.},

Previous modelling has shown the conditions under which cratons may be stable for the present, but cast doubt on how they survived in a more energetic mantle of the past. Here we incorporate an endothermic phase change at 670 km, and a depth-dependent viscosity structure consistent with post-glacial rebound and geoid modelling, to simulate the dynamics of cratons in an "Earth-like" convecting system. We find that cratons are unconditionally stable in such systems for plausible ranges of viscosity ratios between the root and asthenosphere (50-150) and the root/oceanic lithosphere yield strength ratio (5-30). Realistic mantle viscosity structures have limited effect on the average background cratonic stress state, but do buffer cratons from extreme stress excursions. An endothermic phase change at 670 km introduces an additional time-dependence into the system, with slab breakthrough into the lower mantle associated with 2-3 fold stress increases at the surface. Under Precambrian mantle conditions, however, the dominant effect is not more violent mantle avalanches, or faster mantle/plate velocities, but rather the drastic viscosity drop which results from hotter mantle conditions in the past. This results in a large decrease in the cratonic stress field, and promotes craton survival under the evolving mantle conditions of the early Earth.},

It has been suggested that these bursts of tectonic activity are due to mantle avalanche events, where accumulating subducted slabs periodically penetrate the 670~km discontinuity, and subsequent upwelling counterflow and plume activity results in massive volcanism. Here we present paleomagnetic evidence for periods of rapid plate motions coinciding with the observed peaks in crustal age distribution. We present a new model for plate-driven episodic tectonics in the Precambrian, where higher mantle temperatures result in lower lithospheric stresses, causing rapid pulses of subduction interspersed with periods of relative quiescence. Plate-driven episodicity will naturally arise for hotter mantle temperatures of the early Earth and can explain rapid pulses of plate motion and crustal production without the need to invoke mantle avalanche events.},

  abstract = {Conventional diamond exploration guidelines predict that economic diamond occurrences will be restricted to Archaean cratons, where the lithosphere is thick and cool, and diamond is the stable form of carbon in the lower portions of the lithosphere. However, Australia's current economic diamond deposits are not well predicted by these conventional exploration guidelines. Tomographic images show that Australia's economic diamond deposits lie at step changes in lithospheric thickness within dominantly cratonized Proterozoic provinces with thick ({$\geq$}200 km) lithosphere. The thickest portions of the seismic lithosphere in Australia occur not under the major Archaean cratons, rather the central Proterozoic regions of the continent. We use a numerical code to show that such features are stable, and that the longevity of the diamond stability field is dependent on distance to the continent--ocean boundary, local depth of the chemical boundary layer (CBL), and proximity to changes in CBL depth. We also show that abrupt changes in lithospheric thickness focus lithospheric stress gradients, affecting melt migration paths, and that continental melt production is enhanced in regions adjacent to major cratons. Diamond pipes occur where conditions conducive to diamond stability and deep-seated alkaline volcanism (kimberlite or lamproite) occur simultaneously, and the common confluence of these factors at abrupt changes in lithospheric thickness marks them as potential exploration targets.},

  abstract = {Do Archean ages obtained for diamonds from many of the world's cratons constitute a strong constraint on the thermal state of the Archean continental lithosphere? The apparent longevity of diamonds obtained from cratonic kimberlites [Boyd et al., Nature 315 (1985) 387--389; Richardson et al., Nature 310 (1984) 198--202] has been used to infer the physical and chemical isolation of cratonic roots from the convecting mantle since 3 Ga. This would also provide an extremely strong constraint on the thermal history of the lithospheric mantle -- requiring low temperatures at depth for its entire history. Recent evidence suggests, however, that the published `diamond' ages may not represent the ages of the diamonds themselves, but significantly pre-date them [Shimizu and Sobolev, Nature 375 (1995) 308--311; Spetsius et al., Earth Planet. Sci. Lett. 199 (2002) 111--126]. We use a particle-in-cell finite element code to model the thermal stability of the continental lithosphere in a convecting mantle. The continental crust modulates the thermal conditions of the underlying mantle lithosphere, increasing the depth of the thermal boundary layer beneath the continent and providing a mechanism for stabilizing the sub-continental thermal field. If diamonds have survived in cratonic roots since the Archean, the conditions necessary for diamond stability must have existed in the Archean continental lithosphere, and those conditions must have remained relatively unperturbed for {$\sim$}3 Gyr [Boyd et al., Nature 315 (1985) 387--389]. Here, the longevity of the diamond stability field is explored for systems with chemically distinct continental crust and a strongly temperature-dependent mantle viscosity. Such models frequently produce the temperature conditions needed to form diamonds within the Archean lithosphere, but the temperature fluctuations experienced within the modeled mantle lithosphere are generally able to destroy these diamonds within 1 Gyr. Increasing the distance to active margins has only a marginal effect on the longevity of the diamond stability field. Convectively stable cratonic roots extend the lifetime of the diamond stability field in those regions. However, while the residence time of diamonds approaches the order of magnitude required (284--852 Myr), extremely fortuitous mantle conditions are required to explain Archean diamonds.},

  abstract = {Mantle convection is important in understanding the heat flow and thermal structure of the continental lithosphere, as it produces time variability in the surface heat flow, and allows for lateral advection of heat under a continent. Many of the fundamental questions in continental heat flow depend on the magnitude and variability of the mantle contribution to continental heat flow. We summarise the current understanding of the thermal state of the Australian continent, and discuss the application of mantle-convection modelling results to continental heat-flow problems. A parficle-incell finite-element code is used to show how the continental thermal field is modulated through time, and how the calculated mantle heat flow decreases with both root thickness and crustal heat production. An increase in root thickness is shown to enhance the stability of the deep continental thermal field. These modelling results imply a modest variation in the mantle heat flow of Australia through time, and suggest that the variation in mantle heat flow over the stable Precambrlan shield will most likely be Indiscernible. The thickness and thermal structure of the Australian lithosphere is, to a degree, dependent on the history of mantle convection around this continent.},

Alternative explanations for this volcanism include insulation by the continent and thus elevated subcontinental mantle temperatures. Here we model the thermal and dynamic impact of supercontinents on Earth-like mobile-lid convecting systems. We confirm that insulating supercontinents (over 3000~km extent) can impact mantle temperatures, but show the scale of temperature anomaly is significantly less for systems with strongly temperature-dependent viscosities and mobile continents. Additionally, for continents over 8000~km, mantle temperatures are modulated by the development of small-scale convecting systems under the continent, which arise due to inefficient lateral convection of heat at these scales. We demonstrate a statistically robust association between rising plumes supercontinental interiors for a variety of continental configurations, driven largely by the tendency of subducting slabs to lock onto continental margins. The distribution of slabs also affects the spatial positioning of deep mantle thermochemical anomalies, which demonstrate stable configurations in either the sub-supercontinent or intraoceanic domains. We find externally forced rifting scenarios unable to generate significant melt rates, and thus the ultimate cause of supercontinent breakup related volcanism is probably related to dynamic continental rifting in response to mantle reconfiguration events.},

We use viscoplastic mantle convection simulations, with evolving core--mantle boundary temperatures, and radiogenic heat decay, to explore how these factors affect tectonic regime over the lifetime of a planet. The simulations demonstrate (i) hot, mantle conditions, coming out of a magma ocean phase of evolution, can produce a ``hot'' stagnant-lid regime, whilst a cooler post magma ocean mantle may begin in a plate tectonic regime; (ii) planets may evolve from an initial hot stagnant-lid condition, through an episodic regime lasting 1--3Gyr, into a plate-tectonic regime, and finally into a cold, senescent stagnant lid regime after {$\sim$}10Gyr of evolution, as heat production and basal temperatures wane; and (iii) the thermal state of the post magma ocean mantle, which effectively sets the initial conditions for the sub-solidus mantle convection phase of planetary evolution, is one of the most sensitive parameters affecting planetary evolution -- systems with exactly the same physical parameters may exhibit completely different tectonics depending on the initial state employed. Estimates of the early Earth's temperatures suggest Earth may have begun in a hot stagnant lid mode, evolving into an episodic regime throughout most of the Archaean, before finally passing into a plate tectonic regime. The implication of these results is that, for many cases, plate tectonics may be a phase in planetary evolution between hot and cold stagnant states, rather than an end-member.},

This study shows that apatite has a widespread occurrence in Phanerozoic lithospheric mantle and can be divided into two geochemically distinct types using halogen content, presence or absence of structural CO2, Sr and trace element (especially U, Th, and light rare earth) ratios and abundances, and association with either metasomatised mantle wall-rock peridotites (Apatite A) or high-pressure magmatic crystallisation products (Apatite B). Apatite A is inferred to result from metasomatism by CO2- and H2O-rich fluids derived from a primitive mantle source region, while Apatite B compositions are consistent with crystallisation from magmas within the carbonate-silicate compositional spectrum. The presence of significant apatite in the lithospheric mantle is important not only for the geochemical budget but also for assessing heat production and heat flow in the mantle. The measured U and Th contents of mantle apatite average 60 and 200 ppm, respectively and 0.5\% apatite would dominate heat production. Metasomatised mantle may also contain amphibole and mica with K2O and clinopyroxene with detectable U and Th. In lithospheric mantle with a thickness of 70 km, this abundance of apatite would result in mantle heat flow contribution of about 12 mW / m2, a significant proportion of the total 'normal' mantle heat flow of about 18 mW/m2.

  abstract = {The lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB) represents the base of the Earth's lithosphere, the rigid and relatively cool outer shell characterised by a conductive thermal regime, isolated from the convecting asthenosphere. Chemically, the LAB should divide a lithospheric mantle that is variably depleted in basaltic components from a more fertile asthenosphere. In xenolith suites from cratonic areas, the bottom of the depleted lithosphere is marked by a rapid downward increase in elements such as Fe, Ca, Al, Ti, Zr and Y, and a rapid decrease in the median Mg\# of olivine, reflecting the infiltration of mafic melts and related fluids. Eclogites and related mafic and carbonatitic crystallisation products are concentrated at the same depths as the maximum degrees of metasomatism, and may represent the melts responsible for this refertilisation of the lithosphere. This refertilised zone, at depths of ca 170-220. km beneath Archean and Proterozoic cratons, is unlikely to represent a true LAB. Re-Os isotopic studies of the deepest fertile peridotite xenoliths show that they retain evidence of ancient depletion events; seismic tomography data show high-velocity material extending to much greater depths beneath cratons. The cratonic "LAB" probably represents a level where asthenospheric melts have ponded and refertilised the lithosphere, rather than marking a transition to the convecting asthenosphere. Our only deeper samples are rare diamond inclusions and some xenoliths inverted from majoritic garnet, which are unlikely to represent the bulk composition of the asthenosphere.In younger continental regions the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary is shallower (commonly at about 80-100. km). In regions of extension and lithosphere thinning (e.g. eastern China, eastern Australia, Mongolia), upwelling asthenosphere may cool to form the lowermost lithosphere, and may be represented by xenoliths of fertile garnet peridotites in alkali basalts. The LAB is a movable boundary. It may become shallower due to thermal and chemical erosion of the lithosphere, assisted by extension. Refertilised lithospheric sections, especially where peridotites are intermixed with eclogite, may be capable of gravitational delamination. The lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary may also be deepened by subcretion of upwelling hot mantle (e.g. plumes). This process may be recorded in the strongly layered lithospheric mantle sections seen in the Slave Craton (Canada), northern Michigan (USA) and the Gawler Craton (Australia). {\copyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Ocean bottom seismometers were deployed at 3-4 km intervals and seismic sources fired every 120 m along it. Prominent primary and secondary arrivals indicate that the continental crust is extremely thin (locally less than 2 km) across the basin centre. The sedimentary succession is up to 12 km thick and comprises three distinctive seismic layers. The two uppermost layers are interpreted as mostly a post-rift succession of Cretaceous and Cenozoic strata. The lowest layer thins rapidly towards the basin centre and is interpreted as a succession of predominantly Jurassic synrift sediments. A strong asymmetry in both the geometry of the crust and the sedimentary layers is probably related to a simple shear mode of extension and the subsidence that it induced. Crustal thinning is far greater than in the adjacent Rockall Basin and local exhumation of continental mantle lithosphere may have occurred in parts of the Porcupine Basin. Low Pn velocities beneath the Porcupine Arch are compatible with larger amounts of mantle serpentinization than in the Rockall Basin.},

The geotherm is consistent with high measured heat flows and with the low magnetic signature of the region as shown by MAGSAT data. Published measurements of seismic velocity beneath the region show a gradient from Vp {$\sim$} 7.0 km/sec to Vp {$\sim$} 7.8 km/sec from 25--55 km depth, where Vp increases rapidly to ‚™ñ 8.0 km/sec. Calculation of Vp for the xenolith rock types suggests that the mantle from 25 to 55 km consists of spinel lherzolite interleaved with spinel- and garnet-pyroxenites and basaltic cumulates. The seismically defined ``Moho'' beneath southeastern Australia coincides with the depth of the spinel lherzolite-garnet lherzolite transition predicted by the xenolith-derived geotherm.}

  abstract = {Numerous empirical and model-based studies argue that, in general, hillslopes and river channels increase their gradients to accommodate high rates of base-level fall. To date, however, few data sets show the dynamic range of both these relationships needed to test theoretical models of hillslope evolution and river incision. Here, we utilize concentrations of 10Be in quartz extracted from river sand on the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau to explore relationships among short-term (102-105 a) erosion rate, hillslope gradient, and channel steepness. Our data illustrate nonlinear behavior and a threshold in the relationship between erosion rate and mean hillslope gradient, confirming the generalization that hillslopes around the world are limited by slope stability and cease to provide a metric for erosion at high rates ({\textbackslash}textgreater{$\sim$}0.2 mm/a). The relationship between channel steepness index and erosion rate is also nonlinear, but channels continue to steepen beyond the point where threshold hillslopes emerge up to at least 0.6 mm/a, demonstrating that channel steepness is a more reliable topographic metric than mean hillslope gradient for erosion rate and that channels ultimately drive landscape adjustment to increasing rates of base-level fall in tectonically active settings.},

  abstract = {Groundwater management in the Great Artesian Basin (Australia) is challenging due to the large areas and heterogeneity of sequences involved. This challenge has often been addressed with up-scaled conceptual models; however, where there is significant heterogeneity or local competing groundwater uses, more detail is required. When good understanding of heterogeneity within sequences is not available, the upscaled approach can lead to a disparity between model predictions based on homogenisation inherent in upscaling and the observed behaviour of heterogeneous systems, leading to bias in results. This requires improved conceptual resolution of these heterogeneous systems. Geological data are often insufficient to achieve the required resolution. This paper reports on the use of hydrochemical data from existing bores in the Walloon subgroup of the Surat Basin, using compositional data analysis techniques to refine the unit description. The approach moves beyond simple hydrochemical characterisations of water type via conventional hydrochemical interpretations to use a combination of centred- and isometric-log ratios to describe discrete end members. The results show that, despite similar water types, the upper Juandah and lower Taroom coal seams of Walloon subgroup are distinguished by an inverse relationship between ions Cl-, Ca2+, Mg2+, Sr2+, Li- and H+ and ions HCO3-, F- and B3+, and by an isometric log ratio that describes the balance between the activities of Cl, H+ and HCO3. These relationships suggest that higher-resolution conceptual models based on flow paths mapped from hydrochemical data can form the basis for refined groundwater models that address both heterogeneity and regional model domains.},

  abstract = {Nonlinear gravity inversion in sedimentary basins is a classical problem in applied geophysics. Although a 2D approximation is widely used, 3D models have been also proposed to better take into account the basin geometry. A common nonlinear approach to this 3D problem consists in modeling the basin as a set of right rectangular prisms with prescribed density contrast, whose depths are the unknowns. Then, the problem is iteratively solved via local optimization techniques from an initial model computed using some simplifications or being estimated using prior geophysical models. Nevertheless, this kind of approach is highly dependent on the prior information that is used, and lacks from a correct solution appraisal (nonlinear uncertainty analysis). In this paper, we use the family of global Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) optimizers for the 3D gravity inversion and model appraisal of the solution that is adopted for basement relief estimation in sedimentary basins. Synthetic and real cases are illustrated, showing that robust results are obtained. Therefore, PSO seems to be a very good alternative for 3D gravity inversion and uncertainty assessment of basement relief when used in a sampling while optimizing approach. That way important geological questions can be answered probabilistically in order to perform risk assessment in the decisions that are made.},

  abstract = {Coal seam gas (CSG), or coal bed methane, developments in sedimentary basins such as the Great Artesian Basin (GAB) in Australia, have the potential to impact on aquifers overlying and underlying the target coal formations. The extent to which this may occur depends upon the degree of hydrogeological connectivity between the coal formations and the surrounding aquifers or aquifer systems, with general implications for groundwater management. In southeast Australia, one such aquifer system, the Condamine Alluvium (CA), overlies the Walloon Coal Measures (WCM), which is a formation of the GAB and also a target for CSG production. To investigate the connectivity between the two systems, multiple lines of investigation were employed involving field investigations, data gathering and analysis (including reinterpretation of geology, multivariate hydrochemistry analysis, regional water-level mapping, drilling and coring across the contact zone, multiple piezometer installations, long-term pumping tests, groundwater-level monitoring and local-scale modelling). The study found a low level of connectivity between the GAB and the overlying CA. A layer of undifferentiated basement clay (referred to as the `transition zone')---a mixture of alluvial clay and weathered basement---provides an effective impediment to flow across the CA and the underlying GAB formations. Results from the study potentially have wider application across the GAB and sedimentary basins where younger alluvial sediments associated with river systems frequently overlie the erosional surface.},

  abstract = {In most practical situations, the upper part of a geological section consists of loose sediments, in which heat transfer cannot be described as a purely conductive process. To investigate such situations a one-dimensional numerical model of terrestrial temperature field formation under the combined influence of vertical groundwater filtration and ground surface temperature changes has been developed. The model allows one to consider the perturbation of heat flow interval values resulting from short- and long-period temperature waves propagating into permeable rocks under conditions of advective heat transfer, caused by vertical groundwater filtration. The results show that temperature profiles and interval heat flow values are sensitive to both the paleoclimatic history and the rate of groundwater filtration. The latter plays the prevailing role in the variations of geothermal field parameters, especially within the uppermost part of the loose sediments in unconfined aquifers. The problem was solved for a permeable layer, underlaid by an impermeable layer. This schematisation of water exchange is the typically accepted for hydrogeological analysis. Even at very low rates of filtration the intensity of this effect is enhanced substantially for long-period variations. In the extreme case (for periods of temperature variations of the order of 100,000 years) at typical rates of filtration within the permeable layer, an almost gradient-free zone can be formed down to depths of a few hundred metres. For the case of upward filtration, on the contrary, the influence of climatic variations on the terrestrial temperature field becomes substantially attenuated.},

  abstract = {Terrestrial heat flow influences a large collection of geological phenomena. Its determination and understanding is of prime interest for oil industry because geothermal processes impact directly maturation histories and economic potential of oil fields and reservoirs. Published systematic heat flow determinations from major oil provinces are however seldom. Robust heat flow determinations in drillholes require logging of undisturbed temperatures and intensive sampling of core material for petrophysical measurements. Temperature logging in exploration drillholes is traditionally conducted during drilling breaks or shortly after drilling, resulting in temperatures severely disturbed by mud circulation and coring is restricted to selected intervals. Alternatively, test temperatures, information from electric logs and lithological descriptions of drill cuttings can be used to overcome these limitations.The present contribution introduces new heat flow determinations based on 63 exploration drillholes from the Norwegian North Sea, the Mid Norway Margin and the Barents Shelf. Our analyses are based on released DST temperatures, precise lithological descriptions of drill cuttings, previously measured rock matrix thermal conductivities and established porosity laws. For the sake of comparison, we carefully review previous heat flow studies carried out both onshore and offshore Norway.Our results suggest median heat flow values of 64 mW/m2, 65 mW/m2and 72 mW/m2for the North Sea, the Mid Norway Margin (mainly the Tr{\o}ndelag Platform) and the SW Barents Shelf respectively. In detail, heat flow increases by {$\sim$}10 mW/m2from the southern Norwegian North Sea towards the Mid Norway Margin. This result appears to be in very good agreement with seismic tomographic studies suggesting northward thinning of the underlying mantle lithosphere. Our results together with published marine heat flow data from the Mid Norway Margin suggest a gradual decrease in heat flow levels from both the North Sea and the Tr{\o}ndelag Platform towards the centres of the deep M{\o}re and V{\o}ring basins. This latter effect is attributed to reduced heat input from crustal sources caused by the extreme attenuation of the crystalline basement below these two basins. Heat flow in the SW Barents Shelf increases westwards. This is interpreted as lateral heat transfer from the adjacent young ocean. Tentative corrections for Quaternary sedimentation/erosion effects suggest similar heat flow levels for the three studied areas but the above mentioned regional trends remain unchanged.},

Our approach reveals the characteristics and dynamics of the magmatic system with a level of detail that no single method has yet achieved.

The magma chamber may have formed by incremental sill intrusion over a few thousand years and is likely to be a transient, geologically short-lived feature.

  abstract = {Observations of isostatic adjustment of the Earth's surface due to glacial loading provide important constraints on mantle viscosity structure. We solve the forward problem of glacial isostatic adjustment in two complementary ways: a spectral method for strictly 1-D (spherically symmetric) earth models, and a finite element method that can accommodate 3-D viscosity structure. We discuss how each method may be augmented in three ways: to accommodate motion of the centre of mass, to implement a gravitationally self-consistent ocean load via the sea level equation and to include the influence of polar wander. With all these effects implemented, the two methods are benchmarked against each other. We also study the influence of lateral viscosity variations upon measurements of post-glacial rebound (PGR) in two ways: first by observing the effect of viscosity perturbations in an idealized model and second by developing a realistic 3-D viscosity model and comparing it with results of related 1-D (spherically symmetric) models. The 3-D viscosity structure is derived starting from seismic tomography models. We conclude from both approaches that PGR observations are sensitive to both the local viscosity structure and to the viscosity structure beneath the loaded region, even if it is removed from where the observations are made. In particular, PGR measurements made at Hudson Bay tend to reflect the local viscosity structure beneath Hudson Bay; PGR measurements made along the east coast of North America, being sensitive to both the local (east coast) viscosity structure as well as the loaded (continental) viscosity structure, are not reproducible with a 1-D viscosity model.},

  abstract = {In a number of subduction zones, earthquakes at 50-200 km depth define two dipping planes, separated by 20-40 km, that appear to merge downdip. Upper plane earthquakes are inferred to occur within the subducting oceanic crust, whereas lower plane earthquakes occur in the subducting oceanic mantle. Beneath northeast Japan, the results of a new finite-element heat-transfer model suggest that the lower seismic plane cuts across isotherms at a shallow angle. Lower plane earthquakes occur at {$\sim$}550-800 {$^\circ$}C at 100 km depth and at {$\sim$}350-600 {$^\circ$}C at 160 km depth. These conditions coincide with the dehydration reaction antigorite (serpentine) {$\rightarrow$} forsterite + enstatite + H2O, which suggests that lower plane earthquakes may be triggered by dehydration embrittlement, which in turn suggests that the subducting oceanic mantle is partially hydrated. Serpentinization may occur in the trench-outer rise region, where faulting may promote infiltration of seawater several tens of kilometers into the oceanic lithosphere. If this hypothesis is correct, current subduction-zone H2O budgets may significantly underestimate the amount of bound H2O entering the "subduction factory.},

Small-scale physical models of uplifting drainage basins, however, continually reorganize by ridge migration and do not reach an ideal steady state. Here I show that the presence or absence of persistent drainage migration in a bedrock numerical landform evolution model depends on the flow-routing algorithm used to determine upstream contributing area. The model version that uses steepest-descent routing achieves an ideal steady state, while the model version that uses bifurcation routing results in continually-evolving drainage basins, even under conditions of uniform vertical uplift, bedrock erodibility, precipitation, and landsliding threshold. This result suggests that persistent drainage migration can occur by erosional processes alone. This result has important implications for numerical-modeling methodology, our understanding of the natural variability of landform evolution, and the interpretation of thermochronological data.},

Using the spatial pair-correlation function, the number of pairs of magmatic or volcanic events whose separation is between r- << Ar and r + << Ar per unit area, we quantify the spatial clustering of raagraatism and volcanism in several data sets. Statistically self-similar clustering characterized by power law spatial pair-correlation functions is observed. The temporal pair-correlation function is used to identify self-similar temporal clustering of raagraatism and volcanism in the Radiometric Age Data Bank of 11,986 dated intrusive and extrusive rocks in the North American Cordillera. The clustering of raagraatism and volcanism in space and time in this data set is found to be statistically self-similar and identical to those of distributed seismicity. The frequency-size distributions of eruption volume and areal extent of basaltic flows are also found to be self-similar with power laws analogous to the Gutenburg-Richter distribution for earthquakes. In an attempt to understand the origin of statistical self-similarity in raagraatism and volcanism we present one end-member model in which the ascent of magma through a disordered crust of variable macroscopic permeability is modeled with a cellular-automaton model to create a distribution of magma supply regions which erupt with equal probability per unit time. The model exhibits statistical self-similarity similar to that observed in the real data sets. 1.}

  abstract = {Geothermal studies were conducted within the framework of Lithoprobe to systematically document variations of heat flow and surface heat production in the major geological provinces of the Canadian Shield. One of the main conclusions is that in the Shield the variations in surface heat flow are dominated by the crustal heat generation. Horizontal variations in mantle heat flow are too small to be resolved by heat flow measurements. Different methods constrain the mantle heat flow to be in the range of 12-18 mW.m (super -2) . Most of the heat flow anomalies (high and low) are due to variations in crustal composition and structure. The vertical distribution of radioelements is characterized by a differentiation index (D (sub I) ) that measures the ratio of the surface to the average crustal heat generation in a province. Determination of mantle temperatures requires the knowledge of both the surface heat flow and D (sub I) . Mantle temperatures increase with an increase in surface heat flow but decrease with an increase in D (sub I) . Stabilization of the crust is achieved by crustal differentiation that results in decreasing temperatures in the lower crust. Present mantle temperatures inferred from xenolith studies and variations in mantle seismic P-wave velocity (P (sub n) ) from seismic refraction surveys are consistent with geotherms calculated from heat flow. These results emphasize that deep lithospheric temperatures do not always increase with an increase in the surface heat flow. The dense data coverage that has been achieved in the Canadian Shield allows some discrimination between temperature and composition effects on seismic velocities in the lithospheric mantle.},

  abstract = {High-resolution seismic models of 3-D mantle heterogeneity are interpreted in terms of thermal and compositional anomalies residing in Earth's upper mantle. These anomalies produce density perturbations that drive mantle flow and thus provide the source for convection-related geophysical observables, such as the non-hydrostatic geoid, free-air gravity anomalies and dynamic surface topography. These observables, in turn, may be used to provide constraints on mantle density structure. To resolve as accurately as possible the density structure of the subcontinental mantle below North America, we correct the convection data for the isostatically compensated crustal heterogeneity using a newly compiled crustal data set in Canada, which provides stricter control of crustal structure beneath Canada than previously available global crustal models. The crust-corrected surface topography and free-air gravity fields are compared with those predicted by topography-based mantle flow models. Through an Occam inversion of the surface topography and gravity data, we obtain inferences of the velocity-density scaling coefficients that characterize the mantle density anomalies below North America. The inferred density anomalies are inconsistent with the presence of thermal anomalies alone, and require simultaneous anomalies in temperature and composition. The anomalies in density and seismic shear velocity are employed to place constraints on the thermochemical structure of the mantle beneath the North American craton. We employ perturbations in the molar ratio of iron, R = X (sub Fe) /(X (sub Fe) +X (sub Mg) ), to quantify the compositional anomalies in terms of iron depletion in the subcontinental mantle. We thereby obtain the first detailed estimates of the extent of basalt depletion in the tectosphere beneath North America. This depletion produces a local balance between positive chemical buoyancy and the negative buoyancy which would otherwise be produced by the colder temperatures of the subcratonic mantle relative to the suboceanic mantle.},

We use the present-day heat flow data in the Superior Province to calculate the strength of the lithosphere and to show that the uplift took place in the weakest part of the craton. After eliminating heat flow data that were affected by the uplift and later events (Keweenawan rifting), we calculate the heat flow and the temperature field in the lithosphere at 1.9 Ga. We show that the Kapuskasing region was in the center of a ``thermal anomaly'' at this time. The strength of the lithosphere in this region may have been up to 2--3 orders of magnitude lower than in surrounding parts of the craton, depending on crustal heat source distribution. Uplift and the resulting erosion of the upper crust, as evidenced by geothermobarometry data from around Kapuskasing, led to a reduced crustal heat production compared to the average crust of the southern Superior Province. This reduced heat production resulted in low crustal temperatures and a strong lithosphere permitting the long term preservation of a crustal root.},

In the most part of the Basin geothermal gradients are above the global average. It is suggested that geothermal gradients determine the groundwater flow patterns in the Basin aquifers. Six extensive regions where Rayleigh numbers exceed the critical value for the onset of thermal convection are identified. Further numerical experiments with parameters derived from field observations show that thermal convection can actually occur in these regions. The identified convective regions are large in size (of the order of 100 km horizontally) and coincide with important groundwater management zones. Within the convective regions the groundwater flow is not horizontal but has a significant vertical component. Thermally-induced vertical flows result in intensive mass transfer within and between aquifer layers. In the groundwater management context, the latter means a higher degree of vulnerability of the Basin aquifers. Numerical models with incorporated coupling between heat and mass transfer processes are shown to be appropriate for the impact assessment of management strategies in the Basin.},

  abstract = {For nearly half a century, a number of conflicting tectonic models have been postulated to explain the enigmatic geological relationship between Tasmania and Victoria, with a view to unifying our understanding of the evolution of the eastern margin of Gondwana in Australia. In this study, ambient noise data from an array of 24 broadband seismometers is used to produce a high-resolution 3-D crustal shear wave velocity model of Bass Strait, the key to understanding the missing link. We apply a novel transdimensional and hierarchical Bayesian inversion approach to construct group velocity maps in the period range of 2--30s, and subsequently invert group velocity dispersion for 3-D shear wave velocity structure. This allows us to image, for the first time, the entire crust beneath Bass Strait in high detail and elucidate the geometry and position of key crustal features with corroboration from complementary datasets. The three sedimentary basins related to the failed rifting event associated with the Australia--Antarctica breakup, in particular Bass Basin, clearly emerge from the tomographic solution model. A key feature of the 3-D shear wavespeed model is a distinct mid-lower crustal NW--SE high velocity zone which extends from northwestern Tasmania to south-central Victoria, confirming a Proterozoic geological connection. We also image three north--south high velocity belts that appear to span Bass Strait, with some interruption from velocity variations possibly related to more recent tectonic events. These belts are consistent with recent gravity and magnetic maps, and may indicate the presence of an exotic Precambrian terrane (the Selwyn Block). The model also images the crustal velocity structure of the southern Stawell and Bendigo Zones, and their internal large-scale multi-layer characters, a legacy of their Early Paleozoic intra-oceanic origins. Another high velocity anomaly imaged in the mid-lower crust is an east--west lineament beneath the northern part of Bass Strait, which may be an intrusive feature associated with the failed rift.},

  abstract = {For nearly half a century, a number of conflicting tectonic models have been postulated to explain the enigmatic geological relationship between Tasmania and Victoria, with a view to unifying our understanding of the evolution of the eastern margin of Gondwana in Australia. In this study, ambient noise data from an array of 24 broadband seismometers is used to produce a high-resolution 3-D crustal shear wave velocity model of Bass Strait, the key to understanding the missing link. We apply a novel transdimensional and hierarchical Bayesian inversion approach to construct group velocity maps in the period range of 2--30 s, and subsequently invert group velocity dispersion for 3-D shear wave velocity structure. This allows us to image, for the first time, the entire crust beneath Bass Strait in high detail and elucidate the geometry and position of key crustal features with corroboration from complementary datasets. The three sedimentary basins related to the failed rifting event associated with the Australia--Antarctica breakup, in particular Bass Basin, clearly emerge from the tomographic solution model. A key feature of the 3-D shear wavespeed model is a distinct mid-lower crustal NW--SE high velocity zone which extends from northwestern Tasmania to south-central Victoria, confirming a Proterozoic geological connection. We also image three north--south high velocity belts that appear to span Bass Strait, with some interruption from velocity variations possibly related to more recent tectonic events. These belts are consistent with recent gravity and magnetic maps, and may indicate the presence of an exotic Precambrian terrane (the Selwyn Block). The model also images the crustal velocity structure of the southern Stawell and Bendigo Zones, and their internal large-scale multi-layer characters, a legacy of their Early Paleozoic intra-oceanic origins. Another high velocity anomaly imaged in the mid-lower crust is an east--west lineament beneath the northern part of Bass Strait, which may be an intrusive feature associated with the failed rift.},

  abstract = {The usual numerical methods for removing the depressions of a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) gradually fill the depressions and merge the embedded ones. These methods are complex to implement and need large computation time, particularly when the DEM contains a high proportion of random noise. A new method is presented here. It is innovative because, instead of gradually filling the depressions, it first inundates the surface with a thick layer of water and then removes the excess water. The algorithm is simple to understand and to implement, requiring only a few tens of code lines. It is much faster than usual algorithms. Moreover, this method is versatile: depressions can be replaced with a surface either strictly horizontal, or slightly sloping. The first option is used for the calculation of depression storage capacity and the second one for drainage network extraction. The method is fully detailed and a pseudo-code is provided. Its practical computation time, evaluated on generated fractal surfaces, is asymptotically proportional to N-1.2 where N is the number of grid points. The theoretical computation time is asymptotically proportional to N-1.5 in all cases, with the exception of some exotic ones with no practical interest. By contrast, existing methods have a computation time asymptotically proportional to N-2. Applications are done for both generated and measured surfaces with 256 cells to 6.2 million cells.

  abstract = {Subducted sediments play an important role in arc magmatism and crust-mantle recycling. Models of continental growth, continental composition, convergent margin magmatism and mantle heterogeneity all require a better understanding of the mass and chemical fluxes associated with subducting sediments. We have evaluated subducting sediments on a global basis in order to better define their chemical systematics and to determine both regional and global average compositions. We then use these compositions to assess the importance of sediments to arc volcanism, and crust-mantle recycling, and to re-evaluate the chemical composition of the continental crust. The large variations in the chemical composition of marine sediment are for the most part linked to the main lithological constituents. The alkali elements (K, Rb and Cs) and high field strength elemetns (Ti, Nb, Hf, Zr) are closely linked to the detrital phase in marine sediments; Th is largely detrital but may be enriched in the hydrogenous Fe-Mn component of sediments; REE patterns are largely continental, but abundances are closely linked to fish debris phosphate; U is mostly detrital, but also dependent on the supply and burial rate of organic matter; Ba is linked to both biogenic barite and hydrothermal components; Sr is linked to carbonate phases. Thus, the important geochemical tracers follow the lithology of the sediments. Sediment lithologies are controlled in turn by a small number of factors: proximity of detrital sources (volcanic and continental); biological productivity and preservation of carbonate and opal; and sedimentation rate. Because of the link with lithology and the wealth of lithological data routinely collected for ODP and DSDP drill cores, bulk geochemical averages can be calculated to better than 30\% for most elements from fewer than ten chemical analyses for a typical drill core (100-1000 m). Combining the geochemical systematics with convergence rate and other parameters permits calculation of regional compositional fluxes for subducting sediment. These regional fluxes can be compared to the compositions of arc volcanics to assess the importance of sediment subduction to arc volcanism. For the 70\% of the trenches worldwide where estimates can be made, the regional fluxes also provide the basis for a global subducting sediment (GLOSS) composition and flux. GLOSS is dominated by terrigenous material (76 wt\% terrigenous, 7 wt\% calcium carbonate, 10 wt\% opal, 7 wt\% mineral-bound H2O+, and therefore similar to upper continental crust (UCC) in composition. Exceptions include enrichment in Ba, Mn and the middle and heavy REE, and depletions in detrital elements diluted by biogenic material (alkalis, Th, Zr, Hf). Sr and Pb are identical in GLOSS and UCC as a result of a balance between dilution and enrichment by marine phases. GLOSS and the systematics of marine sediments provide an independent approach to the composition of the upper continental crust for detrital elements. Significant discrepancies of up to a factor of two exist between the marine sediment data and current upper crustal estimates for Cs, Nb, Ta and Ti. Suggested revisions to UCC include Cs (7.3 ppm), Nb (13.7 ppm), Ta (0.96 ppm) and TiO2 (0.76 wt\%). These revisions affect recent bulk continental crust estimates for La/Nb and U/Nb, and lead to an even greater contrast between the continents and mantle for these important trace element ratios. GLOSS and the regional sediment data also provide new insights into the mantle sources of oceanic basalts. The classical geochemical distinction between 'pelagic' and 'terrigenous' sediment sources is not valid and needs to be replaced by a more comprehensive understanding of the compositional variations in complete sedimentary columns. In addition, isotopic arguments based on surface sediments alone can lead to erroneous conclusions. Specifically, the Nd/Hf ratio of GLOSS relaxes considerably the severe constraints on the amount of sediment recycling into the mantle based on earlier estimates from surface sediment compositions.}

The interplay between climate-forced sea level change, erosional and depositional processes, and flexural isostasy in deep time on passive margin deltas remains poorly understood. We performed a series of conceptual simulations to investigate flexural isostatic responses to high-frequency fluctuations in water and sediment load associated with climatically driven sea level changes. We model a large drainage basin that discharges to a continental margin and produces a large deltaic depocenter, then prescribe synthetic and climatic-driven sea level curves of different frequencies to assess flexural response. Results show that flexural isostatic responses are bidirectional over 100--1000\,kyr timescales and are in sync with the magnitude, frequency, and direction of sea~level fluctuations and that isostatic adjustments play an important role in driving along-strike and cross-shelf river mouth migration and sediment accumulation. Our findings demonstrate that climate-forced sea level changes produce a feedback mechanism that results in self-sustaining creation of accommodation into which sediment is deposited and plays a major role in delta morphology and stratigraphic architecture.},

The associated closure of the Iapetus Ocean is recorded in the NE\&\#8211;SW structural trends that dominate the tectonic set-up of Ireland today. The deep-crustal dynamics of the orogeny and the effect on the crust of the subsequent extension and magmatism in the North Atlantic are debated. Fabrics within deep crustal rocks preserve a record of deformation during and after the continental collisions. Here, we measured Rayleigh-wave phase velocities using seismograms recorded by permanent and temporary intermediate-band stations in Ireland and inverted the data for phase-velocity maps, including azimuthal anisotropy. The observed isotropic phase-velocity heterogeneity reflects moderate crustal thickness and seismic velocity variations across Ireland. Anisotropy of Rayleigh waves at 10\&\#8211;20 s periods shows a NE\&\#8211;SW fast-propagation direction and is largest (up to 2\%) at a 15 s period, at which Rayleigh waves sample primarily the middle and lower crust. The NE\&\#8211;SW trend of the deep-crustal anisotropic fabric is parallel to tectonic trends, in particular the Iapetus Suture Zone, which indicates that suture-parallel flow in the middle and lower crust accommodated the continental collision. The apparent preservation of the Caledonian-age fabric also shows that the deep crust of the Eurasian margin in Ireland was neither stretched by the NW\&\#8211;SE extension associated with the opening of the North Atlantic, nor modified significantly by the Cenozoic magmatism in the region.},

Thus subsurface temperatures have the potential to extend the 20th century meteorologic temperature record back well into the pre-industrial era and therefore to provide information relevant to an assessment of the role of greenhouse gases in atmospheric warming. Short period variations in surface temperature are attenuated at shallow depths, whereas longer period excursions propagate deeper. The ability to resolve details of the surface temperature history diminishes with time. Care must be taken to identify and evaluate local anthropogenic temperature perturbations such as urbanization, deforestation and wetland destruction and microclimatic effects associated with topography and vegetation patterns, in order to isolate true regional climate change. Investigations in North America indicate significant regional variability in the surface temperature history inferred from borehole profiles, similar to that observed in the meteorologic record of the 20th century.}

However, the Early Ordovician Dol-cyn-afon Formation higher in the succession and the overlying Late Ordovician Conway Castle Sandstone show a more diverse provenance, consistent with derivation from the Monian Supergroup. Cambrian sandstone from the Llanberis Slates Formation in the Arfon Basin shows a distinct provenance dominated by a Neoproterozoic source. None of the samples analyzed contains Laurentian detritus. These results suggest that the Welsh Basin was juxtaposed with the Monian Supergroup and its Precambrian substrate along the Menai Strait Fault System by the Tremadocian, and indicate that the Iapetus Ocean remained open at least until the Silurian. The Cambrian detrital zircon record from the Arfon Basin does not show clear similarity to the Monian Supergroup, nor to the Welsh Basin and adjacent Midland Platform, indicating that the basin was isolated from these sedimentary sources within the fault system. The juxtaposition of these terranes probably took place during strike-slip to transpressional tectonism close to the northern margin of Gondwana during the Early Ordovician.},

  abstract = {This study uses information on composition, thermal state and petrological thickness to calculate the densities of different types of subcontinental lithospheric mantle (SCLM). Data from mantle-derived periodotite xenoliths and garnet-xenocryst suites document a secular evolution in the composition of SCLM: the mean composition of newly formed SCLM has become progressively less depleted, in terms of Al, Ca, mg\# and Fe/Al, from Archean, through Proterozoic to Phanerozoic time. Thermobarometric analyses of xenolith and xenocryst suites worldwide show that the mean lithospheric palaeogeotherms rise from low values (corresponding to surface heat flows of 35-40 m W/m 2) beneath Archean terranes, to higher values ( {\textbackslash}textgreater 50 m W/m 2) beneath regions with Phanerozoic crust. The typical thickness of the lithosphere (defined as a chemical boundary layer), ranges from about 250 to 180 km, 180-150 km and 140-60 km for Archean, Proterozoic and Phanerozoic terranes respectively. The depth of this lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary corresponds to a temperature of 1250-1300??C. Using the estimated compositions, average mineral compositions and experimental data on the densities of mineral end-members (tables 1 and 2), we calculate mean densities at 20??C for Primitive Mantle (3.39 Mg m -3) and for SCLM of Archean (3.31 ??.016 Mg m -3), Proterozoic (3.35 ?? 0.02 Mg m -3) and Phanerozoic (3.36 ?? 0.02 Mg m -3) age. Curves of density and cumulative density versus depth, which take into account variations in geotherm with tectonothermal age, have been constructed for each age type of lithospheric section to assess the buoyancy of these columns relative to the asthenosphere, modelled as a Primitive Mantle composition. The density curves show that Archean SCLM is significantly buoyant relative to the asthenosphere at depths greater than about 60 km. Proterozoic sections deeper than about 100 km thick also are significantly buoyant. The buoyancy of Archean and Proterozoic SCLM sections, combined with their refractory composition, leads to high viscosities and explains the longevity and stability of old SCLM. Replacement of Archean lithosphere, as beneath the present-day eastern Sino-Korean craton, probably involves mechanical dispersal by rifting, accompanied by the rise of hot, fertile asthenospheric material. Fertile Phanerozoic lithosphere is buoyant when the geotherm is sufficiently high, as in many Cenozoic volcanic provinces. However, as the geothermal gradient relaxes toward a stable conductive profile, Phanerozoic SCLM sections thinner than about 100 km become denser than the asthenosphere, and hence gravitationally unstable. This could help to induce delamination of the SCLM and upwelling of asthenospheric material, beginning a new cycle. The tectonic consequences of such lithosphere replacement would include uplift and magmatism and basin formation during subsequent thermal relaxation. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

In calculating P--T projections and compatibility diagrams, the equations used for each equilibrium are the equilibrium relationships for an independent set of reactions between the end-members of the phases in the equilibrium. Invariant points and univariant lines in P--T projections can be calculated directly, as can coordinates in compatibility diagrams. In calculating P--T and T--x/P--x pseudosections -- diagrams drawn for particular bulk compositions -- the equilibrium relationship equations are augmented by mass balance equations. Lines in pseudosections, where the mode of one phase in the lower variance equilibrium is zero, and points, where the modes of two phases are zero, can then be calculated directly. The software, THERMOCALC, allows the calculation of these and a range of other types of phase diagram.

  abstract = {Abstract. Natural fault networks are geometrically complex systems that evolve through time. The evolution of faults and their off-fault damage patterns are influenced by both dynamic earthquake ruptures and aseismic deformation in the interseismic period. To better understand each of their contributions to faulting we simulate both earthquake rupture dynamics and long-term deformation in a visco-elasto-plastic crust subjected to rate- and state-dependent friction. The continuum mechanics-based numerical model presented here includes three new features. First, a 2.5-D approximation is created to incorporate the effects of a viscoelastic lower crustal substrate below a finite depth. Second, we introduce a dynamically adaptive (slip-velocity-dependent) measure of fault width to ensure grid size convergence of fault angles for evolving faults. Third, fault localization is facilitated by plastic strain weakening of bulk rate and state friction parameters as inspired by laboratory experiments. This allows us to simulate sequences of episodic fault growth due to earthquakes and aseismic creep for the first time. Localized fault growth is simulated for four bulk rheologies ranging from persistent velocity weakening to velocity strengthening. Interestingly, in each of these bulk rheologies, faults predominantly localize and grow due to aseismic deformation. Yet, cyclic fault growth at more realistic growth rates is obtained for a bulk rheology that transitions from velocity-strengthening friction to velocity-weakening friction. Fault growth occurs under Riedel and conjugate angles and transitions towards wing cracks. Off-fault deformation, both distributed and localized, is typically formed during dynamic earthquake ruptures. Simulated off-fault deformation structures range from fan-shaped distributed deformation to localized splay faults. We observe that the fault-normal width of the outer damage zone saturates with increasing fault length due to the finite depth of the seismogenic zone. We also observe that dynamically and statically evolving stress fields from neighboring fault strands affect primary and secondary fault growth and thus that normal stress variations affect earthquake sequences. Finally, we find that the amount of off-fault deformation distinctly depends on the degree of optimality of a fault with respect to the prevailing but dynamically changing stress field. Typically, we simulate off-fault deformation on faults parallel to the loading direction. This produces a 6.5-fold higher off-fault energy dissipation than on an optimally oriented fault, which in turn has a 1.5-fold larger stress drop. The misalignment of the fault with respect to the static stress field thus facilitates off-fault deformation. These results imply that fault geometries bend, individual fault strands interact, and optimal orientations and off-fault deformation vary through space and time. With our work we establish the basis for simulations and analyses of complex evolving fault networks subject to both long-term and short-term dynamics.},

  abstract = {Three P wave attenuation models for sedimentary rocks are given a unified theoretical treatment. Two of the models concern wave-induced flow due to heterogeneity in the elastic moduli at ``mesoscopic'' scales (scales greater than grain sizes but smaller than wavelengths). In the first model, the heterogeneity is due to lithological variations (e.g., mixtures of sands and clays) with a single fluid saturating all the pores. In the second model, a single uniform lithology is saturated in mesoscopic ``patches'' by two immiscible fluids (e.g., air and water). In the third model, the heterogeneity is at ``microscopic'' grain scales (broken grain contacts and/or microcracks in the grains), and the associated fluid response corresponds to ``squirt flow.'' The model of squirt flow derived here reduces to proper limits as any of the fluid bulk modulus, crack porosity, and/or frequency is reduced to zero. It is shown that squirt flow is incapable of explaining the measured level of loss (10-2 {\textbackslash}textless Q -1 {\textbackslash}textless 10-1) within the seismic band of frequencies (1--104 Hz); however, either of the two mesoscopic scale models easily produces enough attenuation to explain the field data.},

A new model, PM\_v2\_2012, obtained from 3 {\texttimes} 106 seismograms, agrees well with earlier lower resolution models. It is combined with temperature estimates from oceanic plate models and with pressure and temperature estimates from the mineral compositions of garnet peridotite nodules to generate a number of estimates of SV(P, T) based on geophysical and petrological observations alone. These are then used to estimate the unrelaxed shear modulus and its derivatives with respect to pressure and temperature, which agree reasonably with values from laboratory experiments. At high temperatures relaxation occurs, causing the shear wave velocity to depend on frequency. This behaviour is parameterised using a viscosity to obtain a Maxwell relaxation time. The relaxation behaviour is described using a dimensionless frequency, which depends on an activation energy E and volume V a. The values of E and V a obtained from the geophysical models agree with those from laboratory experiments on high temperature creep. The resulting expressions are then used to determine the lithospheric thickness from the shear wave velocity variations. The resolution is improved by about a factor of two with respect to earlier models, and clearly resolves the thick lithosphere beneath active intracontinental belts that are now being shortened. The same expressions allow the three dimensional variations of the shear wave attenuation and viscosity to be estimated. {\copyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {The lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary corresponds to the base of the "rigid" plates - the depth at which heat transport changes from advection in the convecting deeper upper mantle to conduction in the shallow upper mantle. Although this boundary is a fundamental feature of the Earth, mapping it has been difficult because it does not correspond to a sharp change in temperature or composition. Various definitions of the lithosphere and asthenosphere are based on the analysis of different types of geophysical and geological observations. The depth to the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary determined from these different observations often shows little agreement when they are applied to the same region because the geophysical and geological observations (i.e., seismic velocity, strain rate, electrical resistivity, chemical depletion, etc.) are proxies for the change in rheological properties rather than a direct measure of the rheological properties. In this paper, we focus on the seismic mapping of the upper mantle high velocity lid and low velocity zone and its relationship to the lithosphere and asthenosphere. We have two goals: (a) to examine the differences in how teleseismic body-wave travel-time tomography and surface-wave tomography image upper mantle seismic structure; and (b) to summarise how upper mantle seismic velocity structure can be related to the structure of the lithosphere and asthenosphere. Surface-wave tomography provides reasonably good depth resolution, especially when higher modes are included in the analysis, but lateral resolution is limited by the horizontal wavelength of the long-period surface waves used to constrain upper mantle velocity structure. Teleseismic body-wave tomography has poor depth resolution in the upper mantle, particularly when no strong lateral contrasts are present. If station terms are used, features with large lateral extent and gradual boundaries are attenuated in the tomographic image. Body-wave models are not useful in mapping the thickness of the high velocity upper mantle lid because this type of analysis often determines wave speed perturbations from an unknown horizontal average and not absolute velocities. Thus, any feature which extends laterally across the whole region beneath a seismic network becomes invisible in the teleseismic body-wave tomographic image. We compare surface-wave and body-wave tomographic results using southern Africa as an example. Surface-wave tomographic images for southern Africa show a strong, high velocity upper mantle lid confined to depths shallower than approximately 200 km, whereas body-wave tomographic images show weak high velocity in the upper mantle extending to depths of approximately 300 km or more. However, synthetic tests show that these results are not contradictory. The absolute seismic velocity structure of the upper mantle provided by surface wave analysis can be used to map the thermal lithosphere. Priestley and McKenzie (Priestley, K., McKenzie, D., 2006. The thermal structure of the lithosphere from shear wave velocities. Earth and Planetary Science Letters 244, 285-301.) derive an empirical relationship between shear wave velocity and temperature. This relationship is used to obtain temperature profiles from the surface-wave tomographic models of the continental mantle. The base of the lithosphere is shown by a change in the gradient of the temperature profiles indicative of the depth where the mode of heat transport changes from conduction to advection. Comparisons of the geotherms determined from the conversion of surface-wave wave speeds to temperatures with upper mantle nodule-derived geotherms demonstrate that estimates of lithospheric thickness from V (sub s) and from the nodule mineralogy agree to within about 25 km. The lithospheric thickness map for Africa derived from the surface-wave tomographic results shows that thick lithosphere underlies most of the Archean crust in Africa. The distribution of diamondiferous kimberlites provides an independent estimate of where thick lithosphere exists. Diamondiferous kimberlites generally occur where the lower part of the thermal lithosphere as indicated by seismology is in the diamond stability field.},

  abstract = {Within a seismic reflection processing work flow, the common-reflection-surface (CRS) stack can be applied as an alternative for the conventional normal moveout (NMO) or the dip moveout (DMO) stack. The advantages of the CRS stack include (1) data-driven automatic determination of stacking operator parameters, (2) imaging of arbitrarily curved geological boundaries, and (3) significant increase in signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio by stacking far more traces than used in a conventional stack. In this paper we applied both NMO and CRS stackings to process a sparse 3D seismic data set acquired within a geothermal exploration study in the Polish Basin. The stacked images show clear enhancements in quality achieved by the CRS stack in comparison with the conventional stack. While this was expected from previous studies, we also found remarkable improvements in the quality of seismic attributes when the CRS stack was applied instead of the conventional stack. For the major geothermal target reservoir (Lower Jurassic horizon Ja1), we present a comparison between both stacking methods for a number of common attributes, including root--mean--square (RMS) amplitudes, instantaneous frequencies, coherency, and spectral decomposition attributes derived from the continuous wavelet transform. The attribute maps appear noisy and highly fluctuating after the conventional stack, and are clearly structured after the CRS stack. A seismic facies analysis was finally carried out for the Ja1 horizon using the attributes derived from the CRS stack by using self-organizing map clustering techniques. A corridor parallel to a fault system was identified, which is characterized by decreased RMS amplitudes and decreased instantaneous frequencies. In our interpretation, this region represents a fractured, fluid-bearing compartment within the sandstone reservoir, which indicates favorable conditions for geothermal exploitation.},

In this study, we developed a new method to integrate gravity and gravity gradient data in a 3D density inversion using the non-linear conjugate gradient (NLCG) method and the minimum gradient support (MGS) functional to regularize the 3D inverse problem and to obtain a clear and accurate image of the anomalous body. The NLCG algorithm, which is suitable for solving large-scale nonlinear optimization problems and requires no memory storage, was compared to the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) quasi-Newton algorithm and the results indicated that the convergence rate of NLCG is slower, but that the storage requirement and computation time is lower. To counteract the decay in kernel function, we introduced a depth weighting function for anomalous bodies at the same depth, with information about anomalous body depth obtained from well log and seismic exploration data. For anomalous bodies at different depths, we introduced a spatial gradient weighting function to incorporate additional information obtained in the inversion. We concluded that the spatial gradient weighting function enhanced the spatial resolution of the recovered model. Furthermore, our results showed that including multiple components for inversion increased the resolution of the recovered model. We validated our model by applying our inversion method to survey data from Vinton salt dome, Louisiana, USA. The results showed good agreement with known geologic information; thus confirming the accuracy of this approach.},

  abstract = {Geothermal energy potential is usually discussed in the context of conventional or engineered systems and at the scale of an individual reservoir. Whereas exploration for conventional reservoirs has been relatively easy, with expressions of resource found close to or even at the surface, exploration for non-conventional systems relies on temperature inherently increasing with depth and searching for favourable geological environments that maximise this increase. To utilitise the information we do have, we often assimilate available exploration data with models that capture the physics of the dominant underlying processes. Here, we discuss computational modelling approaches to exploration at a regional or crust scale, with application to geothermal reservoirs within basins or systems of basins. Target reservoirs have (at least) appropriate temperature, permeability and are at accessible depths. We discuss the software development approach that leads to effective use of the tool Underworld. We explore its role in the process of modelling, understanding computational error, importing and exporting geological knowledge as applied to the geological system underpinning the Guangdong Province, China.},

  abstract = {We studied seismic attenuation of P- and S-waves caused by the physical mechanism of wave-induced fluid flow at the mesoscopic scale. Stress relaxation experiments were numerically simulated by solving Biot's equations for consolidation of 2D poroelastic media with finite-element modeling. The experiments yielded time-dependent stress-strain relations that were used to calculate the complex moduli from which frequency-dependent attenuation was determined. Our model consisted of periodically distributed circular or elliptical heterogeneities with much lower porosity and permeability than the background media, which contained 80\% of the total pore space of the media. This model can represent a hydrocarbon reservoir, where the porous background is fully saturated with oil or gas and the low-porosity regions are always saturated with water. Three different saturation scenarios were considered: oil-saturated (80\% oil, 20\% water), gas-saturated (80\% gas, 20\% water), and fully water-saturated media. Varying the dry bulk and shear moduli in the background and in the heterogeneities, a consistent tendency was observed in the relative behavior of the S-wave attenuation among the different saturation scenarios. First, in the gas-saturated media the S-wave attenuation was very low and much lower than in the oil-saturated or in the fully water-saturated media. Second, at low frequencies the S-wave attenuation was significantly higher in the oil-saturated media than in the fully water-saturated media. The P-wave attenuation exhibited a more variable relative behavior among the different saturation degrees. Based on the mechanism of wave-induced fluid flow and on our numerical results, we suggest that S-wave attenuation could be used as an indicator of fluid content in a reservoir. Additionally, we observed that impermeable barriers in the background can cause a significant increase in S-wave attenuation. This suggests that S-wave attenuation could also be an indicator of permeability changes in a reservoir due to, for example, fracturing operations.},

  abstract = {Biot's equations of poroelasticity were solved to study the effects of fracture connectivity on S-wave attenuation caused by wave-induced fluid flow at the mesoscopic scale. The methodology was based on numerical quasistatic pure-shear experiments performed on models of water-saturated rocks containing pairs of either connected or unconnected fractures of variable inclination. Each model corresponded to a representative elementary volume of a periodic medium. Inertial terms were neglected, and hence, the observed attenuation was entirely due to wave-induced fluid flow at the mesoscopic scale. We found that when fractures are not connected, fluid flow in the embedding matrix governs S-wave attenuation, whereas fluid flow through highly permeable fractures, from one fracture into the other one, may dominate when fractures are connected. Each of these energy-dissipation phenomena has a distinct characteristic frequency, with the S-wave attenuation peak associated with flow through connected fractures occurring at higher frequencies than that associated with flow in the embedding matrix. Exploring a range of geometric arrangements of either connected or unconnected fractures at different inclinations, we also observed that the magnitude of S-wave attenuation at both characteristic frequencies shows a strong dependence on fracture inclination. For comparison, we performed quasistatic uniaxial compressibility tests to compute P-wave attenuation in the same models. We found that the attenuation patterns of S-waves tend to differ fundamentally from those of P-waves with respect to fracture inclination. The attenuation characteristics of P- and S-waves in fractured media are thus, largely complementary. With respect to fracture connectivity, we observed that S-wave attenuation tends to follow a specific pattern, indeed, more consistently than that of the P-waves. Our results point to the promising perspective of combining estimates of attenuation of P- and S-waves to infer information on fracture connectivity as well as on the effective permeability of fractured media.}

  abstract = {The evolution of an orogen is marked by phases of topographic growth, equilibrium, and decay. During these phases erosion rates vary in response to temporal and spatial changes in climate, topographic relief and slope, and deformation. Detrital thermochronometer cooling-age data collected from syntectonic basin deposits are a promising tool for quantifying erosion histories during orogenic evolution. Previous studies typically assume steady-state erosion for interpreting detrital data, although in many situations this assumption is not justified. Here we present a new numerical modeling approach that predicts thermochronometer cooling ages in a stratigraphic section where sediment is sourced from a region with a temporally variable erosion history. Multiple thermochronometer cooling ages are predicted at different stratigraphic horizons as a function of variable erosion histories, rock cooling rates in the hinterland, and thermophysical material properties and boundary conditions. The modeling approach provides the context for the interpretation of natural data, including geologically realistic situations with a temporally varying erosion rate. The results of three end-member hinterland erosion histories are explored: (1) steady-state erosion; (2) increasing erosion rate with time; and (3) decreasing erosion rate with time. Results indicate that for steady erosion rates between 0.2 and 1.0 mm/yr, up to 30 m.y. will pass following a change in erosion rate before the detrital ages have adjusted to reflect a new erosion regime. In simulations with transient erosion, the estimation of erosion rates from a detrital record using assumption of thermal steady-state will generally be in error, often by as much as -25 to 100\%. These results highlight that assumptions of steady erosion in mountain belts should be used with caution. Application of the model to thermochronometer cooling ages preserved in syntectonic sediments sourced from the Nanga Parbat region, Himalaya, illustrates how the transient catchment averaged erosion history can be quantified with detrital thermochronology. In this example, we found that erosion rates increased over the past 20 Ma, from about 1.0 mm/yr to modern rates in the range of 1.5 to 2.0 mm/yr.},

There is still no consensus on the minimum survey area required to arrive at a reliable estimate of the Curie isotherm depth. From the available aeromagnetic data over India, depth to the Curie isotherm is estimated using spectral techniques. We found that the significant spectral maxima required to calculate the depth to the Curie isotherm existed only for 4{$^\circ\times$}4{$^\circ$} blocks in southern peninsular India up to 18 {$^\circ$}N latitude and for 5{$^\circ\times$}5{$^\circ$} blocks for the rest of the region in Central India. As aeromagnetic data coverage over India is incomplete, we also calculate the magnetic crustal thickness from the lithospheric model of the CHAMP satellite data for the whole country, using an iterative forward modeling approach. The calculated Curie isotherm is shallow in the mobile belts and deeper in the cratons in both the derivations. As the Curie isotherms calculated from the two data sets collected at very different altitudes using totally different techniques, match reasonably well, it lends credence to the methodology adopted. The derived Curie isotherm depth map is in accordance with the basic structural trend of the major tectonic units within the Indian subcontinent. A comparison is made of the calculated Curie isotherm depth with Moho depths along available DSS profiles over India and it is found that the Curie depth is generally shallower than the Moho depth implying that it possibly represents a thermal boundary rather than a compositional change. Further, we find that high magnitude earthquakes are associated with high gradients in Curie depth.},

The reconstruction of the ground surface temperature (GST) history, based on 1-D theory of heat conduction, was accomplished using the functional space inversion (FSI) method. Because of the paucity of quality thermal conductivity data and because the nature of heat conduction is such that information about GST changes decay with the passage of time, the a-priori standard deviations of the thermal conductivity model (1 W m-1 K-1) and measured temperature (0.2 K) were chosen large enough, so that the GST histories older than 200 years are considerably smoothed and essentially merge with the long-term mean. The average GST history based on consistent results from seven boreholes starts to rise at the end of the last century. The amplitude of the warming is about 0.6 to 0.7 K in the past 100 years. Two boreholes were rejected. The long-term mean GSTs lie between 9.4 and 11.1{$^\circ$}C. The mean annual air temperatures from the Ljubljana meteorological station are in good agreement with the average GST solution. The GST history of the past 20--30 thousand years (ka) was reconstructed from the almost 2-km-deep Ljutomer temperature profile. The history evidences climate variations during the W{\"u}rm (Weichselian) ice age: it places the glacial minimum of about 3{$^\circ$}C at 13--14 ka ago and the postglacial maximum of 10.5{$^\circ$}C roughly at 2--3 ka ago.},

  abstract = {Broad-band and long period magnetotelluric (MT) data were acquired at 39 stations along five NNW-SSE profiles crossing the Iapetus Suture Zone (ISZ) in Ireland. Regional strike analyses indicate that the vast majority of the MT data is consistent with an assumption of a 2-D geoelectric strike direction. Strike is N52?Efor the three easternmost profiles and N75?Efor the two westernmost profiles; these directions correlate well with the observed predominant geological strike of the study region. 2-D inversions of the galvanic distortion-corrected TE and TM mode data from each profile are shown and discussed. As mapped geological variations between the neighbouring profiles suggest a heterogeneous subsurface, it is important to verify the robustness of the presence and geometries of prominent conductivity anomalies by employing 3-D forward and inverse modelling. A high conductivity layer (resistivity of 1-10 ?m), found at middle to lower crustal depths and presumed to be indicative of metamorphosed graphitic sediments rich in sulphides deposited during the convergence of the Laurentian and Avalonian continents, essentially constitutes the electrical signature of the ISZ. Shallow conductors observed are probably due to black shales that were widely deposited within the sedimentary accretionary wedge during Ordovician time. We interpret the moderately low resistivity at shallow depths from west to east across Ireland as indicative of an increase in maturity of the black shales in the easterly direction. From our conductivity models the southern extent of the ISZ is inferred to lie between the Navan Silvermines Fault and the Navan Tipperary Line, and shows clear resistivity contrast along all the profiles at the southern MT stations. The change in resistivity deduced from the 2-D models is spatially related to the composition of Lower Palaeozoic Ordovician, Silurian, Devonian and Carboniferous rocks. At upper mantle depths of about 60 km, a high conductivity block below the central MT stations is found to lie within the accretionary wedge of the Iapetus suture, and the location of the conductive anomaly corroborates reasonably well with the inferred spreading head of the putative Iceland plume-related magmatic intrusion. The low resistivity upper crust beneath the ISZ is indeed rich in Ordovician rocks with black shale content in the eastern as well as the central part; the western part is largely underlain by a highly resistive block of volcanic and metamorphosed rocks forming crystalline basement. ?

Arrays capable of monitoring and recording the streambed response to diurnal temperature variations in the surface water were deployed for a 2-month period in three locations in perennial pools at Maules Creek, New South Wales, Australia. Multi-level array design, field deployment and parameter estimation are discussed. The applicability of analytical solutions derived from the heat transport equation to the streambed environments was analysed using the recorded temperature time series. The stream was found to lose water to the aquifer, which was supported by simultaneously recorded hydraulic gradients. However, the one-dimensional (1D) analytical solutions did not adequately describe the observed streambed thermal response at two locations. The resulting artefacts in the estimated flow velocities are discussed. It was hypothesised that the artefacts originate from model limitation due to streambed heterogeneity and application of 1D solutions to multi-dimensional and dynamic streambed flow. This consequently imposes limitations on the field applicability of the methods. Nevertheless, in combination with time series of surface water and streambed water levels, the use of heat as a tracer provided a powerful tool for better understanding the shallow hydrogeological system. {\copyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

The experiment enabled, for the first time, the precise monitoring of heat and solute tracer movement from a point source in separate runs under identical solid matrix and steady state flow conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that heat transport with natural groundwater flow velocities can reach a transition zone between conduction and convection (0.5 {\textbackslash}textless Pe t {\textbackslash}textless 2.5). The thermal dispersion behavior can be described by using a thermal dispersivity coefficient and the square of the thermal front velocity. We propose an empirical formulation for thermal dispersion with Darcy flow in natural porous media and clarify the disagreement regarding its significance. Finally, it was observed that Darcy velocities independently derived from heat and solute experimentation show a systematic discrepancy of up to 20\%, and that experimental thermal dispersion results contain significant scatter.

  abstract = {Diel temperature fluctuations have been used to quantify vertical water flow through saturated sediments with 1-D analytical heat models. The underlying transport equation relies on assumptions that could be violated using field temperature records. To test the capability of this method a hydraulic laboratory experiment was designed. A mass of fully water-saturated homogeneous sand was exposed to 19 different uniform pressure gradients inducing steady state Darcy velocities 0 {\textbackslash}textless q {\textbackslash}textless 25 m d -1. An areal heating grid generated steady sinusoidal thermal forcing. Multipoint sediment temperature responses demonstrated increasing spatial variability for increasing velocities. This introduced horizontal temperature gradients. Velocities calculated from heat tracing were compared to velocities independently obtained from solute slugs. Heat- and solute-derived velocities agreed for q {\textbackslash}textless 3 m d -1, but heat-derived velocities were consistently larger at higher velocities. Temperature amplitude- and phase-derived velocities revealed significant scatter when compared to solute velocities. This scatter reduced when amplitude- and phase-derived velocities were compared for each sensor pair. The variability in heat-derived velocities therefore represents a spatially variable flow field in the sand. However, amplitude- and phase-derived velocities deviated from a 1:1 relationship at higher velocities. This can partly be explained by longitudinal thermal dispersivity, and partly by enhanced thermal spreading due to horizontal temperature gradients originating from nonuniform flow. This is surprising given the homogeneous sand and transition zone transport conditions (Pe t {\textbackslash}textless 0.7). These findings have implications for the quantification of velocities from field records because field conditions are likely more heterogeneous, which would exacerbate the effects found in this study.

  abstract = {Based on a critical evaluation of several different spectral magnetic depth determination techniques on areally large synthetic layered and random magnetization models, we recommend the following considerations in the usage of the methods as necessary prerequisites to successful bottom depth determinations: (1) using windows with sufficient width to ascertain that the response of the deepest magnetic layer is captured and by verifying the spectra and computing the depth estimates with the largest possible windows ({\textbackslash}textgreater 300-500 km); (2) avoiding filtering to remove arbitrary regional fields, accomplished by compiling magnetic anomalies derived from modern spherical harmonic degree 13 Earth's main field models [e.g. recent International Geomagnetic Reference Field models (IGRF) or Comprehensive models (CM)]; (3) ascertaining the near-circularity of the autocorrelation function to avoid analysing biased spectra containing strong anomaly trends; and (4) avoid determining the slopes from the exponential, low wavenumber part of the spectra in the cases of layered magnetization. We also describe the details of the new spectral peak forward modelling method and discuss the conditions under which the method can lead to useful results. We found that, despite all these precautions, in some cases, the results can still be erroneous and, therefore, we recommend a critical evaluation of the results by modelling heat flow and taking into account seismic information on the crustal and lithospheric thicknesses and seismic velocities wherever possible. In the southcentral US, east of the Rockies, where the surface heat flow ranges between 40 and 65 mW m(-2), we obtained the magnetic bottom depth of 40 +/- 10 km using the approach of the forward modelling of the spectral peak. This range is similar to the seismically derived crustal thickness of 45-50 km, suggesting, therefore, that the entire crust may be magnetic in this region. Because of the uncertainties in the various heat flow contributing parameters, such as the variations in thermal conductivity, radiogenic heat and hydraulic regime, we could not constrain the lithospheric thickness beyond an estimate ranging approximately from 100 to 200 km.},

Using numerical simulations incorporating the coal geometries, we show that the Latrobe Valley coals might elevate the temperature of the rocks at 4 km depth by some 30?35{$^\circ$}C relative to a ?base? condition with no coal. This effectively boosts the average geothermal gradient by about 30\%, with a corresponding improvement in the economic case for geothermal energy in the Latrobe Valley.},

This uncertainty arises from the ill-posed nature of the tomographic inverse problem, which means that multiple models are capable of satisfying the data. The goal of this review is to provide an overview of the current state of the art in the assessment of uncertainty in seismic tomography, and issue a timely reminder that compared to the rapid advances made in many other areas of Earth imaging, uncertainty assessment remains underdeveloped and is often ignored or given minimal treatment in published studies. After providing a historical perspective that dates back to the pioneering work of the early 1970s, the factors that control solution nonuniqueness are discussed, which include data coverage, data noise, choice of parameterization, method used for data prediction and formulation of the inverse problem. This is followed by a description of common methods used to assess solution uncertainty and a commentary on their strengths and weaknesses. The final section of the review presents four case studies involving data sets from Australia and Europe that use different methods to assess uncertainty. The descriptive nature of this review, which does not contain detailed mathematical derivations, means that it is suitable for the many nonspecialists who make use of seismic tomography results but may not have a full appreciation of their reliability.},

This region incorporates a transition from the Precambrian shield region of Australia in the west to younger Phanerozoic terranes in the east, which are thought to have been formed by subduction-accretion processes. Our results, which span the shallow to lower crust, show a strong and consistent pattern of anisotropy that is oriented north-south, approximately parallel to the former margin of East Gondwana. However, significant deviations from this trend persist through the period range 2.5 s to {\textbackslash}textgreater10 s. One of the most notable deviations occurs along the edge of cratonic Australia, where the Curnamona Province forms a salient into the younger accretionary terrane; here, the fast axis of anisotropy follows the boundary almost exactly, and is virtually coincident with magnetic lineations extracted from aeromagnetic data. To the east of this boundary beneath the Lachlan orogen, a region masked by the Cenozoic Murray Basin, the fast axis of anisotropy becomes strongly curved and traces out a semicircular pattern with a radius of 200--250 km. Farther east, the fast axis of anisotropy returns to a dominantly north-south orientation. These new findings provide strong observational support to recent geodynamic modeling results that demonstrate how large-scale oroclinal structures can become embedded in accretionary mountain belts.},

  abstract = {We present a method for the determination of crustal structure by simultaneous inversion of seismic refraction and wide-angle reflection traveltimes for 3-D interface geometry and layer velocity. Crustal structure is represented by layers in which velocity varies linearly with depth, separated by smooth interfaces with a cubic B-spline para- metrization. Lateral variations in structure are therefore represented by variations in interface depth only. The model parametrization we have chosen means that ray paths consist of piecewise circular arc segments for which analytic expressions of trajectory and traveltime are calculated. The two-point problem of finding the first-arrival ray path and traveltime of a specified phase between a given source and receiver is solved using a shooting technique. A subspace inversion method is used to solve the inverse problem, which is formulated as a non-linear optimization problem in which we seek to minimize an objective function that consists of a data residual term and a regularization term. Before performing the inversion, each data pick must be assigned as a refraction or reflection from a particular layer or interface. Since our method represents structure in terms of interfaces, fewer parameters would generally be used in a reconstruction compared to an equivalent 3-D variable-velocity inversion. The method is well suited to wide-angle surveys that consist of many sources and relatively few receivers (or vice versa), such as marine shot lines used in conjunction with land-based receivers. Data coverage in this kind of survey is often sparse and, especially if near-offset ray paths are unavailable, highly variable. A 3-D synthetic test with an array consisting of eight sources lying within a three-sided square of 79 receivers is described. The test model consists of a three-interface structure that includes a layer pinch-out, and the synthetic data set comprises 987 refraction and 930 reflection travel times contaminated with 75 ms of data noise. Six iterations of an 18-D subspace method demonstrate that the method can produce an accurate reconstruction that satisfies the data from a 1-D starting model. We also find that estimates of a posteriori model covariance and resolution obtained from linear theory are useful in analysing solution reliability despite the non- linear nature of the problem. Application of the method to data collected as part of the 1995 TASGO project in Tasmania shows that the method can satisfy 1345 refraction and reflection traveltime picks with a geologically reasonable and robust 254-parameter three-interfacemodel. The inversion results indicate that theMoho beneathNWTasmania varies in depth from 27 km near the coast to 37 km near central Tasmania, with the major increase in depth occurring across the Arthur Lineament.

  abstract = {Cenozoic intraplate volcanism is widespread throughout much of eastern Australia and manifests as both age-progressive volcanic tracks and non-age-progressive lava fields. Various mechanisms have been invoked to explain the origin and distribution of the volcanism, but a broad consensus remains elusive. We use results from seismic tomography to demonstrate a clear link between lithospheric thickness and the occurrence, composition, and volume of volcanic outcrop. Furthermore, we find that non-age-progressive lava fields overlie significant cavities in the base of the lithosphere. Based on numerical simulations of mantle flow, we show that these cavities generate vigorous mantle upwellings, which likely promote decompression melting. However, due to the intermittent nature of the lava field volcanics over the last 50 Ma, it is probable that transient mechanisms also operate to induce or enhance melting. In the case of the Newer Volcanics Province, the passage of a nearby plume appears to be a likely candidate. Our results demonstrate why detailed 3-D variations in lithospheric thickness, plate motion, and transient sources of mantle heterogeneity need to be considered when studying the origin of non age-progressive volcanism in continental interiors.},

The tectonic complexities of this region have been well studied, but most work has been confined to evidence collected from the near surface, where extensive Mesozoic and Cenozoic basin cover masks large tracts of Palaeozoic basement. We apply teleseismic tomography to distant earthquake data recorded by WOMBAT -- the largest transportable seismic array experiment in the southern hemisphere -- to image P-wavespeed variations in the mantle lithosphere beneath the southern portion of the Tasmanides in detail. In order to seamlessly suture together the teleseismic datasets from each of the 14 sub-arrays of WOMBAT, we use P-wavespeeds from the AuSREM model to construct a laterally heterogeneous starting model that captures the long wavelength structural variations that would otherwise be lost through the use of relative arrival time residuals. Synthetic resolution tests indicate good horizontal resolution of {$\sim$}50km within most of the array between depths of 50--350km. A key feature of the 3-D P-wave model is a pronounced easterly high velocity salient in the mantle lithosphere beneath the northern limit of the New England Orocline, which may indicate the presence of underpinning Proterozoic lithosphere that was instrumental in its formation. Another pronounced high velocity anomaly underlies the Curnamona Province, a large crustal block with a strong Archean provenance, which is clearly separated from the Gawler Craton to the west at upper mantle depths by a low velocity zone beneath the Adelaide Fold Belt. We also estimate the location of the eastern boundary of Precambrian Australia at depth, and show that it extends eastward further than previously thought.},

  abstract = {The Easter Seamount Chain and Nazca Ridge are two of the most conspicuous volcanic features on the Nazca plate. Many questions about their nature and origin have remained unresolved because of a lack of geochronological and geochemical data for large portions of both chains. New 40Ar- 39Ar incremental heating age determinations for dredged rocks from volcanoes east of Salas y Gomez Island show that, with very few exceptions, ages increase steadily to the east from 1{$\cdot$}4 to 30 Ma, confirming that the two chains are parts of the same hotspot trail and indicating a hotspot location near Salas y Gomez rather than beneath Easter Island some 400 km farther west. Most of the volcanoes appear to have been erupted onto seafloor that was 5-13 Myr old, and no systematic variation in seafloor age at the time of seamount formation is apparent. At about 23 Ma, the formation of the Nazca Ridge ceased and that of the Easter Seamount Chain began, corresponding to a change in the direction of motion of the Nazca plate. Most of the studied rocks are moderately alkalic to transitional basalts. Their geochemical characteristics suggest that they represent relatively small mean amounts of partial melting initiating in garnet-bearing mantle and ending in the spinel facies. Nd-Sr-Pb isotopic compositions are within the range of values previously observed for volcanoes of the Easter Seamount Chain, west of Easter Island; moreover, most of our data cluster in a rather small part of this range [e.g. {$\epsilon$} Nd(t) is between +6{$\cdot$}0 and +4{$\cdot$}0]. The results indicate that the mantle source has consisted of the same two principal components, a C/FOZO-type component and a high-{$\epsilon$} Nd, incompatible-element-depleted Pacific mid-ocean ridge basalt-source-type component, since at least 30 Ma. The lack of any geochemical gradient along the chain east of Salas y Gomez implies that no systematic change over time has occurred in the proportions of these end-members. {\copyright} The Author 2012.

First horizontal derivatives of the anomaly calculated at various azimuths accentuate linear trends in different directions, while the second derivative helps resolve near surface structure. The dominant NE--SW Caledonian-trending lineaments are interpreted as due to fault boundaries and folds in pre-Carboniferous basement and Caledonian fault reactivation during the Variscan Orogeny. Subsidiary NNE--SSW--trending lineaments are present, as well as weaker NW--SE-trending lineaments. The largest negative anomalies are produced by late Caledonian granites and widespread buried granitic rock in the middle to upper crust is proposed. Both exposed and inferred granites appear to be spatially related to intersections of NE--SW- with NNE--SSW- and NW--SE-trending lineaments.

  abstract = {The Quirico Basin covers an area of 10,000 km (super 2) and is situated to the west of the conventionally defined southwestern margin of the Archean Sao Francisco craton in Minas Gerais State, Brazil. The sedimentary infill of the Quirico Basin consists of lightly metamorphosed shallow marine clastic bedrock sediments of the Bambui Group ( approximately 650+ or -15 Ma), unconformably overlain by Early Cretaceous terrigenous lacustrine (Quirico Formation), alluvial fan (Abaete Formation) and fluvial/aeolian (Tres Barras Formation) deposits of the Areado Group. Rare kimberlites and ubiquitous kamafugites of the Alto Paranaiba Igneous Province (APIP) erupted through the recently deposited sediments of the Quirico Basin in the time period 95-61 Ma. The 120-m-thick Mata da Corda Group overlies the Late Cretaceous Areado Group over an area of 8000 km (super 2) and is composed largely of extrusive kamafugite and related volcanosedimentary material. Unusually large diamonds with proximal surface features and population characteristics are well known to occur in rivers and streams that drain the stratigraphic succession in the Quirico Basin, prompting the search for their presumably local primary source(s) and a possibly associated Archean basement or cratonic root. Conceptual exploration models for this setting may in part be based on the diamondiferous 120 Ma Canastra and 95 Ma Tres Ranchos kimberlites, but require reconciliation with the observed abundance of 85-61 Ma old diamond-free kamafugites. Field relations and carefully controlled stratigraphic samples show that a distinctive mantle-derived indicator mineral suite occurs in the Maxixe Member, a volcaniclastic breccia unit that occurs at the base of the Mata da Corda Group. A detailed thermobarometric comparison of mantle-derived xenocrystic clinopyroxene compositions from this member with clinopyroxene populations derived from kimberlites and kamafugites situated in the Quirico Basin shows a distinct and abrupt change in geothermal conditions at the onset of kamafugite magmatism. Kimberlites entrained fragments of garnet peridotite along a cool, craton-like geotherm which intersected the diamond stability field in the temperature range 880-1000 degrees C. Clinopyroxene xenocrysts in early-stage kamafugites (Maxixe Member) record heating by approximately 240 degrees C, placing much of the deep lithosphere inside the graphite stability field. Clinopyroxenes contained in samples from common APIP kamafugites indicate the loss of the entire garnet-facies lithospheric section, estimated at 75 km thick at the time. This critical event fundamentally changed the lithospheric architecture and geothermal regime of the Quirico Basin from cratonic and "diamond-friendly" to noncratonic and "diamond-unfriendly" over a short time interval. The lithospheric evolution constrained here by judicious investigation of geological relationships during diamond exploration by Canabrava Diamond confirms the potential of the Quirico Basin to host diamondiferous kimberlites that have tapped cool cratonic lithosphere at times prior to eruption of Mata da Corda kamafugites.},

  abstract = {The Palaeoproterozoic era was a time of profound change in Earth evolution and represented perhaps the first supercontinent cycle, from the amalgamation and dispersal of a possible Neoarchaean supercontinent to the formation of the 1.9-1.8 Ga supercontinent Nuna. This supercontinent cycle, although currently lacking in palaeogeographic detail, can in principle provide a contextual framework to investigate the relationships between deep-Earth and surface processes. In this article, we graphically summarize secular evolution from the Earth's core to its atmosphere, from the Neoarchaean to the Mesoproterozoic eras (specifically 3.0-1.2 Ga), to reveal intriguing temporal relationships across the various "spheres" of the Earth system. At the broadest level our compilation confirms an important deep-Earth event at c. 2.7 Ga that is manifested in an abrupt increase in geodynamo palaeointensity, a peak in the global record of large igneous provinces, and a broad maximum in several mantle-depletion proxies. Temporal coincidence with juvenile continental crust production and orogenic gold, massive-sulphide and porphyry copper deposits, indicate enhanced mantle convection linked to a series of mantle plumes and/or slab avalanches. The subsequent stabilization of cratonic lithosphere, the possible development of Earth's first supercontinent and the emergence of the continents led to a changing surface environment in which voluminous banded iron-formations could accumulate on the continental margins and photosynthetic life could flourish. This in turn led to irreversible atmospheric oxidation at 2.4-2.3 Ga, extreme events in global carbon cycling, and the possible dissipation of a former methane greenhouse atmosphere that resulted in extensive Palaeoproterozoic ice ages. Following the great oxidation event, shallow marine sulphate levels rose, sediment-hosted and iron-oxide-rich metal deposits became abundant, and the transition to sulphide-stratified oceans provided the environment for early eukaryotic evolution. Recent advances in the geochronology of the global stratigraphic record have made these inferences possible. Frontiers for future research include more refined modelling of Earth's thermal and geodynamic evolution, palaeomagnetic studies of geodynamo intensity and continental motions, further geochronology and tectonic syntheses at regional levels, development of new isotopic systems to constrain geochemical cycles, and continued innovation in the search for records of early life in relation to changing palaeoenvironments.},

  abstract = {The boundary between Earth's crust and mantle is commonly modelled as a discontinuity surface, theso-called Moho. Although in some regions of the world this model may be too approximate or evenunrealistic, globally speaking it can provide a key to read several long wavelength geophysical signals. Recent research activities have shown the possibility to estimate the Moho discontinuity worldwide from global gravity field model, however usually the solution of this inverse problem requires strong unrealistic hypotheses. In this work a new procedure to relax some of these unrealistic hypotheses is devised and described indetails. Basically it allows to estimate the mean Moho depth even once the normal gravitational field isremoved if at least one seismic observation is available, to take into account the dependency of the crust density on the radial direction (usually neglected in Moho depth determination from gravity), to correctthe a-priori density model of the crystalline crust for scale factors again using seismic information andfinally to consider a Moho with a non-constant depth as reference surface in the inversion, thus reducing the linearization error. The new procedure is here applied to GOCE data to estimate a new crustal model. For this purpose additional external information has been used, such as topography, bathymetry and ice sheet modelsfrom ETOPO1, a recent 1{$^\circ$} {\texttimes} 1{$^\circ$} sediment global model and some prior hypotheses on crustal density. Inparticular the main geological provinces, each of them characterized by its own relation between densityand depth, have been considered. A model describing lateral density variations of the upper mantle isalso taken into account.The new crustal model is computed at a spatial resolution of 0.5{$^\circ\times$} 0.5{$^\circ$}, its gravitational effect differs from GOCE observations of 49 mE and its Moho depth error standard deviation is globally of 3.4 km. Therefore the result seems to be an improvement in terms of resolution, consistency with the gravity field and accuracy not only with respect to previously released GEMMA models, but also with respect tothe current state-of-the-art global knowledge of the Earth crust.},

  abstract = {Community detection algorithms from the field of network theory have been used to divide a fluid domain into clusters that are sparsely connected with each other and to identify barriers to transport, for example in the context of larval dispersal. Communities detected by the community detection algorithm Infomap have barriers that have been shown to often coincide with well-known oceanographic features. Thus far, this method has only been applied to closed domains such as the Mediterranean. We apply this method to the surface of the Arctic and subarctic oceans and show that it can be applied to open domains. First, we construct a Lagrangian flow network by simulating the exchange of Lagrangian particles between different bins in an icosahedral-hexagonal grid. Then, Infomap is applied to identify groups of well-connected bins. The resolved transport barriers include naturally occurring structures, such as the major currents. As expected, clusters in the Arctic are affected by seasonal and decadal variations in sea-ice concentration. We also discuss several caveats of this method. Firstly, there is no single definition of what makes a cluster, since this is dependent on a preferred balance of internally high connectivity, sparse connectivity between clusters, and the spatial scale of investigation. Secondly, many different divisions into clusters may qualify as good solutions and it may thus be misleading to only consider the solution that optimizes a certain quality parameter the most. Finally, while certain cluster boundaries lie consistently at the same location between different good solutions, other boundary locations vary significantly, making it difficult to assess the physical meaning of a single solution. Particularly in the context of practical applications like planning Marine Protected Areas, it is important to consider an ensemble of qualifying solutions to find persistent boundaries.},

Growth of the continental crust is necessary to maintain approximately constant freeboard, because the secular decline in the heat production of the mantle causes the ocean basins to deepen. An equation for the growth of the continents as a function of the decline in terrestrial heat flow yields approximately constant growth rate since the Archean of 0.9 km (super 3) a (super -1) , in good agreement with the above estimate. On the average, Archean growth rates must have been 3 to 4 times the present rate.

We determined the major and trace element composition of 40 samples from this core. Our results show that the incompatible element ratios, such as Zr/Nb, which are correlated with Pb isotopic ratios, are more variable in the lower 408 m of Mauna Kea shield lavas than in the overlying 2855 m ({$\sim$}450 ka). We argue that this geochemical diversity was present in the mantle source of Mauna Kea shield lavas and does not require the inter-fingering of lavas from adjacent volcanoes. Because of uncertainties in Ni partitioning between olivine and melt and the wide range of Ni contents in peridotites, we show that all Mauna Kea lavas may have been derived from a peridotite source. We also obtained major and trace element compositions for 24 whole-rock clasts and hyaloclastites and 7 glasses from HSDP Phase-1 core between 1767 and 1808 mbs. These enigmatic lavas, previously recognized by the distinctive high CaO and K{\textbackslash}textlessinf{\textbackslash}textgreater2{\textbackslash}textless/inf{\textbackslash}textgreaterO contents of their glasses, are also relatively enriched in highly incompatible trace elements. We show that this group of lavas have affinities with post-shield lavas and argue that they are a consequence of lower degrees of melting ({$\sim$}a factor of two) than other Mauna Kea shield lavas, thereby providing evidence that magma supply varied significantly during the growth of the Mauna Kea shield.

These quantities depend on the depth and harmonic degree of loading. They can be integrated as Green functions to obtain the dynamic response due to an arbitrary distribution of internal density contrasts. Spherically symmetric, self-gravitating flow models are constructed for a variety of radial Newtonian viscosity variations and flow configurations including both whole mantle and layered convection. We demonstrate that boundary deformation due to internal loading reaches its equilibrium value on the same time scale as postglacial rebound, much less than the time scale for significant change in the convective flow pattern, by calculating relaxation times for a series of spherically symmetric viscous earth models. For uniform mantle viscosity the geoid signature due to boundary deformations is larger than that due to internal loads, resulting in net negative geoid anomalies for positive density contrasts. Geoid anomalies from intermediate-wavelength density contrasts are amplified by up to an order of magnitude. Geoid anomalies are primarily the result of density contrasts in the interior of convecting layers; density contrasts near layer boundaries are almost completely compensated. Layered mantle convection results in smaller geoid anomalies than mantle-wide flow for a given density contrast. Viscosity stratification leads to more complicated spectral signatures. Because of the sensitivity of the dynamic response functions to model parameters, forward models for the geoid can be used to combine several sources of geophysical data (e.g., subducted slab locations, seismic velocity anomalies, surface topography) to constrain better the structure and viscosity of the mantle.},

  abstract = {Estimates of global mean sea level during past warm periods provide an important constraint on ice sheet stability under prolonged warming and have been used to inform projections of future sea-level change. The Mid-Pliocene Warm Period (MPWP), {\textasciitilde}3 million years ago, has been a particular focus since it represents the most recent interval in Earth history with inferred temperatures and atmospheric CO2 concentrations similar to those expected in the near future. Although several sea-level estimates for this period have been obtained from palaeoshoreline records, they differ by many metres due to spatially variable Pliocene-to-recent vertical motions of the crust, caused by geodynamic processes including sedimentary loading, tectonic activity, glacial isostatic adjustment, and mantle convection. To address this issue and place more robust bounds on the amplitude of MPWP sea level, we combine a continent-wide suite of Australian sea-level markers with geodynamic simulations to quantify and remove post-Pliocene vertical motions at the continental scale. We find that dynamic topography related to mantle convection is the dominant process responsible for deflecting Australian MPWP sea-level markers and that correcting for it and glacial isostatic adjustment yields a global mean sea-level estimate of +16.0{\textasciicircum}\{+5.5\}\_\{-5.6\} m (50th/16th/84th percentiles). Although this range is consistent with other estimates from geomorphic sea-level indicators, the upper bound is lower than assumed in recent ice sheet modelling studies, suggesting a significantly more stable Antarctic Ice Sheet under future warming scenarios.},

  abstract = {Half-space cooling and plate models of varying complexity have been proposed to account for changes in basement depth and heat flow as a function of lithospheric age in the oceanic realm. Here, we revisit this well-known problem by exploiting a revised and augmented database of 2,028 measurements of depth to oceanic basement, corrected for sedimentary loading and variable crustal thickness, and 3,597 corrected heat flow measurements. Joint inverse modeling of both databases shows that the half-space cooling model yields a mid-oceanic axial temperature that is {\textbackslash}textgreater100{$^\circ$}C hotter than permitted by petrologic constraints. It also fails to produce the observed flattening at old ages. Then, we investigate a suite of increasingly complex plate models and conclude that the optimal model requires incorporation of experimentally determined temperature- and pressure-dependent conductivity, expansivity, and specific heat capacity, as well as a low-conductivity crustal layer. This revised model has a mantle potential temperature of 1300 {\textpm} 50{$^\circ$}C, which honors independent geochemical constraints and has an initial ridge depth of 2.6 {\textpm} 0.3 km with a plate thickness of 135 {\textpm} 30 km. It predicts that the maximum depth of intraplate earthquakes is bounded by the 700{$^\circ$}C isothermal contour, consistent with laboratory creep experiments on olivine aggregates. Estimates of the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary derived from studies of azimuthal anisotropy coincide with the 1175 {\textpm} 50{$^\circ$}C isotherm. The model can be used to isolate residual depth and gravity anomalies generated by flexural and sub-plate convective processes.},

The model is derived using full-waveform tomography. More specifically, we minimise the instantaneous phase misfit between synthetic and observed body- as well as surface-waveforms iteratively in a full three-dimensional, adjoint inversion. Highlights of the model in the upper mantle include a well-resolved Mid-Atlantic Ridge and two distinguishable strong low-velocity regions beneath Iceland and beneath the Kolbeinsey Ridge west of Jan Mayen. A sub-lithospheric low-velocity layer is imaged beneath much of the oceanic lithosphere, consistent with the long-wavelength bathymetric high of the North Atlantic. The low-velocity layer extends locally beneath the continental lithosphere of the southern Scandinavian Mountains, the Danish Basin, part of the British Isles and eastern Greenland. All these regions experienced post-rift uplift in Neogene times, for which the underlying mechanism is not well understood. The spatial correlation between the low-velocity layer and uplifted regions suggests dynamic support by low-density asthenosphere originating from the Iceland and Jan Mayen hotspots. Our model further suggests a lower-mantle source for the Iceland and Jan Mayen hotspots. Two distinguishable low-velocity conduits are imaged, connecting the upper-mantle anomalies beneath Iceland and Jan Mayen into the lower mantle. Both conduits are tilted to the South-East, reflecting the westward motion of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The location of the imaged Iceland conduit is in agreement with the observation of a locally thinned transition zone south of Iceland from receiver function studies. {\copyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

This data set is an order of magnitude larger than used for S20RTS and includes new data types. The data are related to shear-velocity perturbations from the (anisotropic) PREM model via kernel functions and ray paths that are computed using PREM. Contributions to phase delays and traveltimes from the heterogeneous crust are estimated usingmodelCRUST2.0.We calculate crustal traveltimes from long-period synthetic waveforms rather than using ray theory. Shear-velocity perturbations are parametrized by spherical harmonics up to degree 40 and by 21 vertical spline functions for a total of 35 301 degrees of freedom. S40RTS is characterised by 8000 resolved unknowns. Since we compute the exact inverse, it is straightforward to determine models associated with fewer or more unknowns by adjusting the model damping. S40RTS shares many characteristics with S20RTS because it is based on the same data types and similar modelling procedures. However, S40RTS shows more clearly than S20RTS the abrupt change in the pattern of shear-velocity heterogeneity across the 660-km phase transition and it presents a more complex patern of shear-velocity heterogeneity in the lower mantle. Utilities to visualise S40RTS and software to analyse the resolution of S40RTS (or models for different damping parameters) are made available.},

  abstract = {Plate tectonics is expressed most simply in oceanic plates where a thermal boundary layer or "lithosphere" forms and thickens as the plate cools during its journey away from mid-ocean ridges. Numerous studies based dominantly on surface observables have established that the oceanic lithosphere, particularly across the Pacific, does not cool continuously as it ages. Based on a seismic model of the Pacific upper mantle inferred from a new compilation of seismic surface wave dispersion measurements, we show that, on average, the Pacific lithosphere has experienced a punctuated cooling history, cooling diffusively at ages until approximately 70 Ma and then reheating in the Central Pacific between ages of 70 and 100 Ma predominantly at depths between 70 and 150 km. At ages from 100 Ma to about 135 Ma, the processes of reheating are substantially weaker than in the Central Pacific. We show that thermal boundary layer instabilities (TBI) develop naturally as the plate cools and, with the right rheology, can explain the mean characteristics of the observed cooling history of the Pacific plate.},

  abstract = {Results from seismic tomography provide information on the thermal structure of the continental upper mantle. This is borne out by the good agreement between tectonic age, surface heat flow and a tomographic S-wave velocity model for depths less than 180 km. The velocity anomalies of tomographic layers deeper than 230 km have relatively small amplitudes and show little correlation with surface heat flow or shallow velocities. We associate the drop in correlation and amplitude of the velocity perturbations between 180 and 230 km depth with the maximum thickness of the thermal boundary layer (TBL), in which larger variations in temperature and possibly composition than in the underlying convecting mantle can be sustained. Velocity profiles for different tectonic provinces are converted to temperature using mineralogical data. Both anharmonic and anelastic effects on the wave speeds are taken into account. The resulting geotherms differ most at depths of 60-120 km with variations of up to 900 degrees C. Below 230 km, differences do not exceed 300 degrees C. These geotherms agree well with one-dimensional conductive geotherms for the observed range of continental heat flow values using the empirical relationship that 40\% of the surface heat flux stems from upper crustal radiogenic heat production. The S-wave velocity in the continental upper mantle appears to be adequately explained (within the uncertainties of the tomography and the conversion to temperature) by a thermal signature. A compositional component can, however, not be ruled out as it may have only a minor effect on the velocity and the heat flow. The surface heat flow is controlled by the shallow heat production and the thickness of the TBL. Seismology helps to determine the relative importance of the two factors and our results confirm the similar importance of both factors. Variations of TBL thickness could be controlled by compositional differences and/or by the effect of temperature on the rheology.},

We report on new measurements of heat flow and radiogenic heat production in 30 boreholes at 17 locations in this province. With these data, reliable values of heat flow and heat production are available at 45 sites in the THO. The mean and standard deviation of heat flow values are 42 9 mW m(-2). In this province, distinctive geological domains are associated with specific heat flow distributions. The heat flow pattern follows the surface geology with a central area of low values over an ancient back arc basin (Kisseynew) and an ancient island arc (Lynn Lake Belt) made of depleted juvenile rocks. Higher heat flow values found in peripheral belts are associated with recycled Archean crust. Within the Canadian Shield, there is no significant variation in heat flow as a function of age between provinces spanning about 2 Gyr. There is no geographic trend in heat flow across the Canadian Shield from the THO to the Labrador Sea. Low heat flow areas where the crustal structure is well-known are used to determine an upper bound of 16 mW m(-2) for the mantle heat flow. Present and paleogeotherms are calculated for a high heat flow area in the Thompson metasedimentary belt. The condition that melting temperatures were not reached in Proterozoic times yields a lower bound of 11-12 mW m(-2) for the mantle heat flow.},

Conservation of angular momentum dictates that these perturbations change the direction of the rotation vector of the planet, a process known as true polar wander (TPW). Although the existence of TPW on Earth is firmly established, its rate and magnitude over geologic time scales remain controversial. Here we present scaling analyses and numerical simulations of TPW due to mantle convection over a range of parameter space relevant to planetary interiors. For simple rotating convection, we identify a set of dimensionless parameters that fully characterize true polar wander. We use these parameters to define timescales for the growth of moment of inertia perturbations due to convection and for their relaxation due to true polar wander. These timescales, as well as the relative sizes of convective anomalies, control the rate and magnitude of TPW. This analysis also clarifies the nature of so called ``inertial interchange'' TPW events, and relates them to a broader class of events that enable large and often rapid TPW. We expect these events to have been more frequent in Earth's past.},

These motions were calculated using up-todate kinematic data predominantly based on magnetic isochrons in the Atlantic Ocean and published by various authors during the last 15 years. It is shown that convergence of Africa with respect to Europe commenced during the Cretaceous Normal Superchron (CNS), between chrons M0 and 34 (120 -- 83 Ma). This motion was subjected to fluctuations in convergence rates characterised by two periods of relatively rapid convergence (during Late Cretaceous and Eocene -- Oligocene times) that alternated with periods of slower convergence (during the Paleocene and since the Early Miocene). Distinct changes in plate kinematics are recognised in the motion of Iberia with respect to Europe, indicated by: (1) a Late Jurassic -- Early Cretaceous left-lateral strike -- slip motion; (2) Late Cretaceous convergence; (3) Paleocene quiescence; (4) a short period of right-lateral strike -- slip motion; and (5) final Eocene -- Oligocene convergence. Based on these results, it is speculated that a collisional episode in the Alpine orogeny at ca. 65 Ma resulted in a dramatic decrease in the relative plate motions and that a slower motion since the Early Miocene promoted extension in the Mediterranean back-arc basins.},

  abstract = {Large-scale tectonic processes introduce a range of crustal lithologies into the Earth's mantle. These lithologies have been implicated as sources of compositional heterogeneity in mantle-derived magmas. The model being explored here assumes the presence of widely dispersed fragments of residual eclogite (derived from recycled oceanic crust), stretched and stirred by convection in the mantle. Here we show with an experimental study that these residual eclogites continuously melt during upwelling of such heterogeneous mantle and we characterize the melting reactions and compositional changes in the residue minerals. The chemical exchange between these partial melts and more refractory peridotite leads to a variably metasomatised mantle. Re-melting of these metasomatised peridotite lithologies at given pressures and temperatures results in diverse melt compositions, which may contribute to the observed heterogeneity of oceanic basalt suites. We also show that heterogeneous upwelling mantle is subject to diverse local freezing, hybridization and carbonate-carbon-silicate redox reactions along a mantle adiabat.}

  abstract = {Analytical solutions to the heat transport equation in porous media have been developed in the past to estimate surface water-groundwater interactions. These solutions, however, are based upon simplifying assumptions that are frequently violated in natural systems. A nonvertical flow field, inherent to most field settings, can violate the one-dimensional (1-D) flow assumption and lead to erroneous velocity estimates. In this study, we have developed a 2-D heat and mass transport finite element-based numerical model for a stream aquifer cross section experiencing flow-through. Synthetic multilevel streambed temperature time series were generated with the model using a sinusoidal temperature boundary. The temperature data was used to quantify the vertical flow velocity with a 1-D analytical solution based on the amplitude decay and phase shift of temperature with depth. Results demonstrate that erroneous vertical components of fluid velocity can be obtained by the 1-D analytical solution when the true vertical velocity approaches zero and the flow regime becomes almost horizontal. The results also illustrate that the amplitude ratio method performs quite poorly on the gaining side of the stream where the only reliable method is phase shift. On the losing side of the stream, both methods can be employed but a better estimation is obtained from the amplitude ratio method. In general, amplitude ratio and phase shift data should be used in conjunction to maximize the information of the system. {\copyright} 2012. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.},

  abstract = {Groundwater investigations for drought water supply for the greater Sydney area were initiated in the Sydney Basin in late 2004 as part of the NSW Government's Metropolitan Water Plan suite of initiatives to find emergency water-supply sources during a severe drought period. A number of priority areas were drilled and tested between 2004 and 2008 to assess the groundwater resource potential of several Triassic and Permian sandstone units. At Kangaloon in the Southern Highlands, the Triassic fractured Hawkesbury Sandstone aquifers were prospective for emergency water supply with bore yields generally in excess of 3 L/s for most sites with the occasional site in excess of 30 L/s. Water levels were mostly less than 15 metres (m) from the surface with artesian conditions at several sites. The water quality was excellent with the areas within the proposed borefield area all having salinities less than 400 {$\mu$}S/cm. At Leonay-Emu Plains in western Sydney, the Hawkesbury Sandstone was thicker than at Kangaloon, and bore yields were consistently higher with predicted yields (to last several years) assessed to be between 10 and 20 L/s. Artesian conditions prevail to the north of Emu Plains. Water salinities up to 1700 {$\mu$}S/cm were identified with the best water quality below 80 m where the salinities were generally less than 400 {$\mu$}S/cm. At Wallacia, in southwestern Sydney, there was more variability in the permeability of the Hawkesbury Sandstone with predicted bore yields assessed to be between 2 and 10 L/s, although there were a couple of sites with yields of up to 40 L/s. Artesian conditions prevail to the south of Wallacia in the Bents Basin area. Water salinities up to 4300 {$\mu$}S/cm were identified in the Hawkesbury Sandstone with the best water quality below 150 m where the salinities were generally between 400 and 1600 {$\mu$}S/cm.

  abstract = {Over the last decade, the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) has evolved into a valuable alternative to continuum computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods for the numerical simulation of several complex fluid-dynamic problems. Recent advances in lattice Boltzmann research have considerably extended the capability of LBM to handle complex geometries. Among these, a particularly remarkable option is represented by cell-vertex finite-volume formulations which permit LBM to operate on fully unstructured grids. The two-dimensional implementation of unstructured LBM, based on the use of triangular elements, has shown capability of tolerating significant grid distortions without suffering any appreciable numerical viscosity effects, to second-order in the mesh size. In this work, we present the first three-dimensional generalization of the unstructured lattice Boltzmann technique (ULBE as unstructured lattice Boltzmann equation), in which geometrical flexibility is achieved by coarse-graining the lattice Boltzmann equation in differential form, using tetrahedrical grids. This 3D extension is demonstrated for the case of 3D pipe flow and moderate Reynolds numbers flow past a sphere. The results provide evidence that the ULBE has significant potential for the accurate calculation of flows in complex 3D geometries. Copyright {\copyright} 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Earth's tectonic plates are generally considered to be driven largely by negative buoyancy associated with subduction of oceanic lithosphere. In this context, mid-ocean ridges (MORs) are passive plate boundaries whose divergence accommodates flow driven by subduction of oceanic slabs at trenches. We show that over the past 80 million years (My), the East Pacific Rise (EPR), Earth's dominant MOR, has been characterized by limited ridge-perpendicular migration and persistent, asymmetric ridge accretion that are anomalous relative to other MORs. We reconstruct the subduction-related buoyancy fluxes of plates on either side of the EPR. The general expectation is that greater slab pull should correlate with faster plate motion and faster spreading at the EPR. Moreover, asymmetry in slab pull on either side of the EPR should correlate with either ridge migration or enhanced plate velocity in the direction of greater slab pull. Based on our analysis, none of the expected correlations are evident. This implies that other forces significantly contribute to EPR behavior. We explain these observations using mantle flow calculations based on globally integrated buoyancy distributions that require core-mantle boundary heat flux of up to 20 TW. The time-dependent mantle flow predictions yield a long-lived deep-seated upwelling that has its highest radial velocity under the EPR and is inferred to control its observed kinematics. The mantle-wide upwelling beneath the EPR drives horizontal components of asthenospheric flows beneath the plates that are similarly asymmetric but faster than the overlying surface plates, thereby contributing to plate motions through viscous tractions in the Pacific region.},

After collision about 50 million years ago, crust was shortened in western and central Tibet, while large fragments of lithosphere moved from the collision zone toward areas of trench rollback in the western Pacific and Indonesia. Cessation of rapid Pacific trench migration ( approximately 15 to 20 million years ago) coincided with a slowing of fragment extrusion beyond the plateau and probably contributed to the onset of rapid surface uplift and crustal thickening in eastern Tibet. The latter appear to result from rapid eastward flow of the deep crust, probably within crustal channels imaged seismically beneath eastern Tibet. These events mark a transition to the modern structural system that currently accommodates deformation within Tibet.},

  abstract = {Erosion by bedrock river channels is commonly modeled with the stream power equation. We present a two-part approach to solving this nonlinear equation analytically and explore the implications for evolving river profiles. First, a method for non-dimensionalizing the stream power equation transforms river profiles in steady state with respect to uniform uplift into a straight line in dimensionless distance-elevation space. Second, a method that tracks the upstream migration of slope patches, which are mathematical entities that carry information about downstream river states, provides a basis for constructing analytical solutions. Slope patch analysis explains why the transient morphology of dimensionless river profiles differs fundamentally if the exponent on channel slope, n, is less than or greater than one and why only concave-up migrating knickpoints persist when n{\textbackslash}textless1, whereas only concave-down migrating knickpoints persist when n{\textbackslash}textgreater1. At migrating knickpoints, slope patches and the information they carry are lost, a phenomenon that fundamentally limits the potential for reconstructing tectonic histories from bedrock river profiles. Stationary knickpoints, which can arise from spatially varying uplift rates, differ from migrating knickpoints in that slope patches and the information they carry are not lost. Counterparts to migrating knickpoints, called stretch zones, are created when closely spaced slope patches spread to form smooth curves in distance-elevation space. These theoretical results are illustrated with examples from the California King Range and the Central Apennines.},

Modeling suggests that these phenomena are the result of continental convergence where the lower crust is so weak that upper crustal deformation is decoupled from the motion of the underlying mantle. This model also predicts east-west extension on the high plateau without convective removal of Tibetan lithosphere and without eastward movement of the crust east of the plateau.},

  abstract = {Formation of placer accumulations in fluvial environments requires 103--106 or even greater times concentration of heavy minerals. For this to occur, regular sediment supply from erosion of adjacent topography is required, the river should remain within a single course for an extended period of time and the material must be reworked such that a high proportion of the sediment is removed while a high proportion of the heavy minerals remains. We use numerical modeling, constrained by observations of circum-Pacific placer gold deposits, to explore processes occurring in evolving river systems in dynamic tectonic environments. A fluvial erosion/transport model is used to determine the mobility of placer gold under variable uplift rate, storm intensity, and rock mass strength conditions. Gold concentration is calculated from hydraulic and bedload grain size conditions. Model results suggest that optimal gold concentration occurs in river channels that frequently approach a threshold between detachment-limited and transport-limited hydraulic conditions. Such a condition enables the accumulation of gold particles within the framework of a residual gravel lag. An increase in transport capacity, which can be triggered by faster uplift rates, more resistant bedrock, or higher intensity storm events, will strip all bedload from the channel. Conversely, a reduction in transport capacity, triggered by a reduction in uplift rate, bedrock resistance, or storm intensity, will lead to a greater accumulation of a majority of sediments and a net decrease in gold concentration. For our model parameter range, the optimal conditions for placer gold concentration are met by 103 times difference in strength between bedrock and fault, uplift rates between 1 and 5 mm a-1, and moderate storm intensities. Fault damage networks are shown to be a critical factor for high Au concentrations and should be a target for exploration.},

These models are Earth-like in terms of convective vigour, thermal structure, surface heat-flux and the geographic distribution of heterogeneity. The models generate a degree-2 dominated spectrum of dynamic topography, with negative amplitudes above subducted slabs (i.e. circum-Pacific regions and southern Eurasia) and positive amplitudes elsewhere (i.e. Africa, north-west Eurasia and the central Pacific). Model predictions are compared with published observations and subsidence patterns from well data, both globally and for the Australian and South African regions. We find that our models reproduce the long-wavelength component of these observations, although observed smaller-scale variations are not reproduced. We subsequently define ``geodynamic rules'' for how different surface tectonic settings are affected by mantle processes: (i) locations in the vicinity of a subduction zone show large negative dynamic topography amplitudes; (ii) regions far away from convergent margins feature long-term positive dynamic topography; (iii) rapid variations in dynamic support occur along the margins of overriding plates (e.g. Western US) and at points located on a plate that rapidly approaches a subduction zone (e.g. India and Arabia). Our models provide a predictive quantitative framework linking mantle convection with plate tectonics and sedimentary basin evolution, thus improving our understanding of how subduction and mantle convection affect the spatio-temporal evolution of basin architecture.{\textbackslash}textless/p{\textbackslash}textgreater}

  abstract = {The last deglacial warming of the high-latitude North Atlantic Ocean (40-65??) occurred in three discrete steps: in the southeast and central regions at 13 000 B.P.; in the central and northern sectors at 10 000 B.P.; and in the western (Labrador Sea) sector between 9000 and 6000 B.P. This regionally time-transgressive sequence was punctuated by a major cooling and polar front readvance from 11 000 to 1000 B.P.; this briefly returned most of the high-latitude North Atlantic to almost full-glacial temperatures. Carbonate productivity levels reached minimum values from 16 000 B.P. to 13 000 B.P. and then gradually rose, reaching maximum values in the Holocene at about 6000 B.P. We interpret these changes in carbonate productivity as indicating a major influx of products of glacial wastage (meltwater and icebergs) from 16 000 to 13 000 B.P., with considerably reduced influx after 13 000 B.P. Combined with evidence for meltwater influx to the Gulf of Mexico via the Mississippi River, this suggests that the bulk of volumetric deglaciation in the Northern Hemisphere occurred considerably earlier than the main areal retreat of ice-sheet limits. This implies that the still-extensive ice sheets in the Northern Hemisphere were relatively thin by 13 000 B.P. Because there is no palynologic evidence of unusual atmospheric warming on the southern margins of the ice sheets before 13 000 B.P., we infer that this early phase of rapid ice disintegration occurred largely by iceberg calving and marine downdraw. We also infer that from 16 000 to 13 000 B.P. low winter insolation combined with a low-salinity meltwater layer to form sea ice south to 50??N; after that date, the winter sea-ice cover diminished significantly. We infer from this that the critical flux of winter moisture to the ice sheets was largely cut off from 16 000 to 13 000 B.P. and still significantly suppressed after 13 000 B.P. Moisture starvation thus hastened the disintegration of Northern Hemisphere ice masses. The brief but strong oceanic cooling roughly coincident with the European Younger Dryas (11 000 to 10 000 B.P.) appears to mark a major influx of tabular icebergs from a disintegrating Arctic ice shelf, perhaps enhanced by external forcing at higher frequencies (2500 yr). ?? 1981.},

  abstract = {Convection in the Earth's mantle appears to be strongly time-dependent on geological time scales. However, we lack direct observations which would help constrain the temporal variation of convection on time scales of 1-10 Ma. Recently, it has been demonstrated that transient uplift events punctuated the otherwise uniform thermal subsidence of sedimentary basins which fringe the Icelandic plume. In the Faroe-Shetland basin, three-dimensional seismic reflection surveys calibrated by well logs have been used to reconstruct a approximately 55 million year old transient event. The minimum amount of uplift is 490 m, which grew and decayed within 2 Ma. This event has also been mapped 400 km further east in the North Sea basin, where peak uplift with an amplitude of 300 m occurred 0.3-1.6 Ma later. Neither observation can be explained by glacio-eustatic sea-level changes or by crustal shortening. We describe a simple fluid dynamical model which accounts for these transient and diachronous observations. In this model, we assume that the Icelandic plume was already in existence and that it had an axisymmetric geometry in which hot (e.g. 1400 degrees C) asthenospheric material flows away from a central conduit within a horizontal layer. A transient temperature anomaly introduced at the plume centre flows outward as an expanding annulus. Its geometry is calculated using radial flow between two parallel plates with a Poiseuille cross-stream velocity profile. The expanding annulus of hot asthenosphere generates transient isostatic uplift at the Earth's surface. Stratigraphic observations from both basins can be accounted for using a plume flux of 1.3xX10 (super 8) km (super 3) Ma (super -1) for a layer thickness of 100 km. Plume flux is broadly consistent with that required to account for Neogene (0-20 Ma) V-shaped ridges south of Iceland, although our transient temperature anomalies are larger. We suspect that the stratigraphic expression of transient convective behaviour is common and that a careful examination of appropriate records could yield important insights.},

  abstract = {Geophysical, petrological, and geochemical data provide important clues about the composition of the deep continental crust. On the basis of seismic refraction data, we divide the crust into type sections associated with different tectonic provinces. Each shows a three-layer crust consisting of upper, middle, and lower crust, in which P wave velocities increase progressively with depth. There is large variation in average P wave velocity of the lower crust between different type sections, but in general, lower crustal velocities are high ({\textbackslash}textgreater6.9 km s\${\textbackslash}backslash\$n -1) and average middle crustal velocities range between 6.3 and 6.7 km s\${\textbackslash}backslash\$n -1. Heat-producing elements decrease with depth in the crust owing to their depletion in felsic rocks caused by granulite facies metamorphism and an increase in the proportion of mafic rocks with depth. Studies of crustal cross sections show that in Archean regions, 50-85\% of the heat flowing from the surface of the Earth is generated within the crust. Granulite terrains that experienced isobaric cooling are representative of middle or lower crust and have higher proportions of mafic rocks than do granulite terrains that experienced isothermal decompression. The latter are probably not representative of the deep crust but are merely upper crustal rocks that have been through an orogenic cycle. Granulite xenoliths provide some of the deepest samples of the continental crust and are composed largely of mafic rock types. Ultrasonic velocity measurements for a wide variety of deep crustal rocks provide a link between crustal velocity and lithology. Meta-igneous felsic, intermediate and mafic granulite, and amphibolite facies rocks are distinguishable on the basis of P and S wave velocities, but metamorphosed shales (metapelites) have velocities that overlap the complete velocity range displayed by the meta-igneous lithologies. The high heat production of metapelites, coupled with their generally limited volumetric extent in granulite terrains and xenoliths, suggests they constitute only a small proportion of the lower crust. Using average P wave velocities derived from the crustal type sections, the estimated areal extent of each type of crust, and the average compositions of different types of granulites, we estimate the average lower and middle crust composition. The lower crust is composed of rocks in the granulite facies and is lithologically heterogeneous. Its average composition is mafic, approaching that of a primitive mantlederived basalt, but it may range to intermediate bulk compositions in some regions. The middle crust is composed of rocks in the amphibolite facies and is intermediate in bulk composition, containing significant K, Th, and U contents. Average continental crust is intermediate in composition and contains a significant proportion of the bulk silicate Earth's incompatible trace element budget (35-55\% of Rb, Ba, K, Pb, Th, and U).},

  abstract = {Simulating the geological processes that control sedimentary basin formation and evolution requires multi-scale and multi-physics numerical models. Multi-scale, because lithosphere processes (e.g. thinning, flexure, heat transfer) and sedimentary basin processes (e.g. sedimentation, compaction, maturation) need to be resolved. Multi-physics, because thermal, structural, and infill modeling needs to be coupled. Regardless of their complexity, numerical models are only as good as the input and reference data on which they are based. A key fitting parameter in basin modeling is the seismically observed stratigraphy. We present an algorithm for the automated inversion of basin stratigraphy for crustal stretching, mantle stretching, and paleobathymetry. The method is based on the coupling a 2-D thermotectonostratigraphic forward model to an inverse scheme that updates the model parameters. The forward model solves for lithospheric thinning, flexural isostasy, sediment deposition, sediment compaction, transient heat flow and mineral phase transformations. The inverse model updates the crustal and mantle thinning factors and paleo-water depth until the input stratigraphy is fitted to a desired accuracy. Both models combined allow for automated sedimentary basin reconstructions. The potential and robustness of this method is demonstrated through two case studies. In the first case study, we apply the presented algorithm to the well studied Viking Graben, North Sea. This study demonstrates how multiple datasets (e.g. stratigraphy, well temperature, vitrinite reflectance) can be integrated into the automated inversion. The second case study addresses the structural and thermal evolution of a passive margin (Voring basin, Norwegian Sea) and illustrates the feedbacks between "deep" lithosphere and "shallow" sedimentary basin processes.},

We investigate how changes in the incoming plate's hydration and thermal structure may effect the efficiency of sub-arc water release from sediments, crust, and serpentinized mantle. We find that serpentinized lithospheric mantle may not only be an important fluid source to trigger arc melting but is also an efficient 'transport-lithology' to recycle chemically bound water into the deeper mantle. In fact, an old slab may remain sufficiently cold during subduction to retain up to 40\% of its initial 'mantle' water at 8 GPa ({$\sim$}240-km depth) after serpentine transforms to higher pressure hydrous phase A. Furthermore, deep water recycling at subduction zones is parameterized in terms of slab age and speed. Coupling this parameterization to a parameterized mantle convection evolution model allows us to calculate the mantle-surface geologic water cycle throughout the Earth's history. We find that the present-day Earth mantle may be highly outgassed containing only a small fraction of the Earth's water, which would mostly be recycled water from the exosphere. {\copyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The model leads to a constitutive flow law which is of the same form as that for Coble creep. It is argued that the presence of a fluid film in stressed grain boundaries leads to enhanced diffusivity of solute particles in the grain boundary. Some simple experiments are described, which demonstrate rapid diffusion in solutions in pores, much slower diffusion in stressed interfaces and deformation by pressure solution. By using the theoretical model, and by assuming that the pressure of the interfacial solution is equal to the applied normal stress, so that available experimental data on the effect of pressure on mineral solubility could be used, rates of deformation by pressure solution have been calculated. These are compared with rates of deformation by crystal plastic and high temperature diffusive flow processes, by using deformation mechanism maps. Predicted transition conditions between various deformation mechanisms are found to be consistent with those inferred from the study of textures of naturally deformed rocks.},

Underworld uses a material point method to track the full history information of Lagrangian material points, of stratigraphic layers and of free surfaces. We show that Underworld successfully reproduces the results of other full-Stokes models for the benchmark experiments of the Ice Sheet Model Intercomparison Project for Higher-Order Models (ISMIP-HOM). Furthermore, we test finite-element meshes with different geometries and highlight the need to be able to adapt the finite-element grid to discontinuous interfaces between materials with strongly different properties, such as the ice--bedrock boundary.},

It is characterised by high heat flow, with more than 90\% of the heat flow measurements exceeding the world mean and high values extending to the coasts - providing good prospects for geothermal energy resources. In this study, we aim to map the depth to the Curie isotherm (580. {$^\circ$}C) in the central Red Sea based on magnetic data. A modified spectral analysis technique, the "de-fractal spectral depth method" is developed and used to estimate the top and bottom boundaries of the magnetised layer. We use a mathematical relationship between the observed power spectrum due to fractal magnetisation and an equivalent random magnetisation power spectrum. The de-fractal approach removes the effect of fractal magnetisation from the observed power spectrum and estimates the parameters of depth to top and depth to bottom of the magnetised layer using iterative forward modelling of the power spectrum. We applied the de-fractal approach to 12 windows of magnetic data along a profile across the central Red Sea from onshore Sudan to onshore Saudi Arabia. The results indicate variable magnetic bottom depths ranging from 8.4. km in the rift axis to about 18.9. km in the marginal areas. Comparison of these depths with published Moho depths, based on seismic refraction constrained 3D inversion of gravity data, showed that the magnetic bottom in the rift area corresponds closely to the Moho, whereas in the margins it is considerably shallower than the Moho. Forward modelling of heat flow data suggests that depth to the Curie isotherm in the centre of the rift is also close to the Moho depth. Thus Curie isotherm depths estimated from magnetic data may well be imaging the depth to the Curie temperature along the whole profile. Geotherms constrained by the interpreted Curie isotherm depths have subsequently been calculated at three points across the rift - indicating the variation in the likely temperature profile with depth. {\copyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Many studies have examined the role of initial rheological layering, geothermal gradients, and extension rates during a single rifting event. This approach neglects the tectonic history of many basins that are marked by multiple rifting events. Here we address the role of repeated extension on long-term lithospheric strain modes and the resulting basins, highlighting cases most affected by previous rifting events. We use numerical models of a lithosphere undergoing two rifting events of differing extension rates and separated by cooling, to show the effect of early events on subsequent evolution. The combination of boundary displacement velocity in both events leads to the formation of various rift basin types, ranging from narrow to wide to hyperextended and with variation of subsidence patterns, degrees of symmetry, and melt yield. We show that basin type, subsidence, and melt production might be strongly affected by previous rifting events, illustrating cases in which the previous rifting history cannot be neglected. Our models reproduce the first-order features of Earth's sedimentary basins and propose a classification to guide the interpretation of extensional basins and their evolution.},

  abstract = {Automatic differentiation (AD) is the technique whereby output variables of a computer code evaluating any complicated function (e.g. the solution to a differential equation) can be differentiated with respect to the input variables. Often AD tools take the form of source to source translators and produce computer code without the need for deriving and hand coding of explicit mathematical formulae by the user. The power of AD lies in the fact that it combines the generality of finite difference techniques and the accuracy and efficiency of analytical derivatives, while at the same time eliminating human' coding errors. It also provides the possibility of accurate, efficient derivative calculation from complex forward' codes where no analytical derivatives are possible and finite difference techniques are too cumbersome. AD is already having a major impact in areas such as optimization, meteorology and oceanography. Similarly it has considerable potential for use in non-linear inverse problems in geophysics where linearization is desirable, or for sensitivity analysis of large numerical simulation codes, for example, wave propagation and geodynamic modelling.

  abstract = {A discussion of methodologies for nonlinear geophysical inverse problems is presented. Geophysical inverse problems are often posed as optimization problems in a finite- dimensional parameter space. An Earth model is usually described by a set of parameters representing one or more geophysical properties (e.g. the speed with which seismic waves travel through the Earth's interior). Earth models are sought by minimizing the discrepancies between observation and predictions from the model, possibly, together with some regularizing constraint. The resulting optimization problem is usually nonlinear and often highly so, which may lead to multiple minima in the misfit landscape. Global (stochastic) optimization methods have become popular in the past decade. A discussion of simulated annealing, genetic algorithms and evolutionary programming methods is presented in the geophysical context. Less attention has been paid to assessing how well constrained, or resolved, individual parameters are. Often this problem is poorly posed. A new class of method is presented which offers potential in both the optimization and the `error analysis' stage of the inversion. This approach uses concepts from the field of computational geometry. The search algorithm described here does not appear to be practical in problems with dimension much greater than 10.},

  abstract = {Non-linear inverse problems in the geosciences often involve probabilistic sampling of multimodal density functions or global optimization and sometimes both. Efficient algorithmic tools for carrying out sampling or optimization in challenging cases are of major interest. Here results are presented of some numerical experiments with a technique, known as Parallel Tempering, which originated in the field of computational statistics but is finding increasing numbers of applications in fields ranging from Chemical Physics to Astronomy. To date, experience in use of Parallel Tempering within earth sciences problems is very limited. In this paper, we describe Parallel Tempering and compare it to related methods of Simulated Annealing and Simulated Tempering for optimization and sampling, respectively. A key feature of Parallel Tempering is that it satisfies the detailed balance condition required for convergence of Markov chain Monte Carlo (McMC) algorithms while improving the efficiency of probabilistic sampling. Numerical results are presented on use of Parallel Tempering for trans-dimensional inversion of synthetic seismic receiver functions and also the simultaneous fitting of multiple receiver functions using global optimization. These suggest that its use can significantly accelerate sampling algorithms and improve exploration of parameter space in optimization. Parallel Tempering is a meta-algorithm which may be used together with many existing McMC sampling and direct search optimization techniques. It's generality and demonstrated performance suggests that there is significant},

  abstract = {Heterogeneity is the single most salient feature of hydrogeology. An enormous amount of work has been devoted during the last 30 years to addressing this issue. Our objective is to synthesize and to offer a critical appraisal of results related to the problem of finding representative hydraulic conductivities. By representative hydraulic conductivity we mean a parameter controlling the average behavior of groundwater flow within an aquifer at a given scale. Three related concepts are defined: effective hydraulic conductivity, which relates the ensemble averages of flux and head gradient; equivalent conductivity, which relates the spatial averages of flux and head gradient within a given volume of an aquifer; and interpreted conductivity, which is the one derived from interpretation of field data. Most theoretical results are related to effective conductivity, and their application to real world scenarios relies on ergodic assumptions. Fortunately, a number of results are available suggesting that conventional hydraulic test interpretations yield (interpreted) hydraulic conductivity values that can be closely linked to equivalent and/or effective hydraulic conductivities. Complex spatial distributions of geologic hydrofacies and flow conditions have a strong impact upon the existence and the actual values of representative parameters. Therefore it is not surprising that a large body of literature provides particular solutions for simplified boundary conditions and geological settings, which are, nevertheless, useful for many practical applications. Still, frequent observations of scale effects imply that efforts should be directed at characterizing well-connected stochastic random fields and at evaluating the corresponding representative hydraulic conductivities.

  abstract = {The relationship between intraslab seismicity and the dynamics of subduction is a subject of ongoing debate. Uncertainty surrounds (1) the extent to which the stress regime associated with slab earthquakes reflects the driving/resisting forces of subduction, or more localised processes such as metamorphic or thermo-elastic volume change, and (2) the relative contribution of uniform (stretching/shortening) and flexural (bending/buckling) deformation modes in slabs. Because variations in slab curvature are very clear in subduction zones with flat slab segments, such settings allow for assessment of the relationship between slab geometry, bending and seismicity. Using a numerical model that reproduces published flat slab geometries we show how bending rates, which are dominated by the advective component, relate to downdip curvature gradients. Based on published slab geometries, we show that the patterns of seismicity in the Peruvian and Mexican flat slabs, vary systematically with slab curvature gradient. Seismicity is restricted to regions colder than about 600{$^\circ$}C. This means that only the upper half of flat slab bending zones are expressed seismically, providing the appearance of a uniform extensional regime.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The Pacific Plate underwent a significant change in motion during the early Eocene. This change has been linked to plate boundary reconfiguration, particularly in relation to subduction margins. The reconfiguration also resulted in a new Pacific-Australian plate boundary section transecting Zealandia. Following the Eocene transition, the relative rotation axis was located within continental Zealandia, and it has been hypothesized that this region acted as a pivot point. Here we investigate the extent to which collision resistance along the intra-continental Zealandia margin (length {$\sim$}1,000~km) might have impacted the motion of the Pacific Plate, which is characterized by trench lengths more than an order of magnitude greater. We first highlight the relatively large radial component in the Pacific Plate absolute rotation during the period ca. 47 and 32~Ma (i.e., the spin around the plate centroid axis). We then consider how parameterized plate boundary forces impact the tangential and radial components of the net torque (i.e., the fictitious and true torque components). We show that during this period, both the Zealandia and Izu-Bonin-Marianas (IBM) margins of the Pacific Plate were well-oriented in terms of partitioning boundary normal forces into counter-clockwise (CCW) radial torques. This analysis is supported by results from recent global-scale numerical models. The role of Zealandia cannot be established unambiguously, based on our analysis, but effects can be quantified under different assumptions. Collision resistance along the Zealandia margin could plausibly constitute a ``first order'' effect on Eocene Pacific Plate rotation, albeit only on the radial component.           ,              Key Points                                                                During the Eocene tectonic reorganization, the Pacific Plate rotation vector developed increased radial component (spin around the centroid)                                                     The geometry of both the Zealandia and Izu-Bonin-Marianas (IBM) margins would have facilitated strong radial torque partitioning of plate boundary normal forces                                                     Global-scale numerical models support our geometric analysis, particularly in terms of the role of theIBM margin},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Numerical subduction models often implement an entrained weak layer (WL) to facilitate decoupling of the slab and upper plate. This approach is attractive in its simplicity, and can provide stable, asymmetric subduction systems that persist for many tens of millions of years. In this study we undertake a methodological analysis of the WL approach, and use these insights to guide improvements to the implementation. The issue that primarily motivates the study is the emergence of significant spatial and temporal thickness variations within the WL. We show that these variations are mainly the response to volumetric flux gradients, caused by the change in boundary conditions as the WL material enters and exits the zone of decoupling. The time taken to reach a quasi-equilibrium thickness profile will depend on the total plate convergence, and is around 7\&thinsp;Myr for the models presented here. During the transient stage, width variations along the WL can exceed 4{\texttimes}, which may impact the effective strength of the interface, through physical effects if the rheology is linear, or simply if the interface becomes inadequately numerically resolved. The transient stage also induces strong sensitivity to model resolution. By prescribing a variable-thickness WL at the outset of the model, and by controlling the limits of the layer thickness during the model evolution, we find improved stability and resolution convergence of the models.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Individual strandlines that can be traced from elevations of {$\sim$} 120 m near Cobden to {$\sim$} 245 m on the Ferguson Hill structure are displaced across northeast-trending faults and monoclines associated with the Simpson and Ferguson Hill structures. A break in slope in the Otway Range front at elevations of 230--280 m, beneath which drainage incision parallels the trends of the strandlines, probably correlates with the Pliocene coastline on the ancestral Otway Range. By analogy with correlative systems in the Murray Basin, deposition occurred during sea-stands between 0 and 65 m above present-day sea-level, implying uplift of between 175 and 240 m since the Early Pliocene. Enhanced incision parallel to the strandlines, in combination with tilting of fault blocks about northeast axes at a high angle to the strandlines, has facilitated the development of a remarkable rectilinear drainage net. Local inversion of the drainage where it focused basalt flows constrains the age of incision and faulting to greater than ca 1 Ma and, most probably, less than ca 2 Ma.},

Provided that the heat production is largely concentrated in the upper half of the crust, these factors result in significant increases in temperature at deep crustal and upper mantle levels. Because the Moho depth is likely to be reduced in the long-term limit of an isostatically balanced basin, these same factors may lead to slight cooling or slight heating of the Moho, depending on the nature of the basin-fill. For a Brace-Goetze lithospheric rheology (i.e. a rheology governed by a combination of frictional sliding and power-law creep), significant long-term lithospheric weakening (up to 5\% per kilometre of basin-fill) accompanies basin formation when the lower crust is initially relatively strong and the basin fill is characterised by appreciable heat production and low thermal conductivity. In contrast, initially weak lower-crustal rheologies may result in long-term lithospheric strengthening. Evidence for basin-inversion in the geological record may therefore imply that heat production is strongly concentrated in the upper half of the crust and, under normal continental thermal regimes, the lower crust is strong.},

The evolution of the neotectonic strain field deduced from historical seismicity and both onshore and offshore faulting records is used to address the origin of this unusual stress field. Strain rates derived from estimates of the seismic moment release rate (up to {$\sim$}10-16 s-1) are compatible with Quaternary fault--slip rates. The record of more or less continuous tectonic activity extends back to the terminal Miocene or early Pliocene (10--5 Ma). Terminal Miocene tectonic activity was characterised by regional-scale tilting and local uplift and erosion, now best preserved by unconformities in offshore basins. Plate-scale stress modelling suggests the in situ stress field reflects increased coupling of the Australian and Pacific Plate boundary in the late Miocene, associated with the formation of the Southern Alps in New Zealand.

In contrast, the southern shelf is typically less than 100 km wide and shows a record of progressive offlap with Neogene palaeo-shorelines commonly many hundreds of kilometres inland, at elevations up to {$\sim$}250 m above present-day sea level. This continental-scale `reciprocal' stratigraphy implies 250--300 m N-down, SSW-up apparent vertical motion with respect to sea level since the mid-Miocene. The apparent vertical motion can be attributed to variations in dynamic topography and the geoid along Australia's NNE plate circuit; specifically, the movement of the southern margin off the dynamic topography low, geoid low presently centred on the Australian-- Antarctic discordance, and the northern margin towards a dynamic topography low, geoid high associated with the subduction realm to the north. Variations in the geoid appear to account for about 10\% of the total apparent motion, depending on assumptions about how the geoid field has evolved during Australia's northward motion. This inferred Neogene, continental-scale dynamic N--S tilting rate of {$\sim$}15--20 m/myr provides a compelling new constraint on the nature of the Earth's dynamic topographic field.},

  abstract = {The mechanisms of formation and disruption of supercontinents have been topics of debate. Based on the Y-shaped topology, we identify two major types of subduction zones on the globe: the Circum-Pacific subduction zone and the Tethyan subduction zone. We propose that the process of formation of supercontinents is controlled by super downwelling that develops through double-sided subduction zones as seen in the present day western Pacific, and also as endorsed by both geologic history and P-wave whole mantle tomography. The super-downwelling swallows all material like a black hole in the outer space, pulling together continents into a tight assembly. The fate of supercontinents is dictated by superplumes (super-upwelling) which break apart the continental assemblies. We evaluate the configuration of major supercontinents through Earth history and propose the tectonic framework leading to the future supercontinent Amasia 250 million years from present, with the present day Western Pacific region as its frontier. We propose that the tectosphere which functions as the buoyant keel of continental crust plays a crucial role in the supercontinental cycle, including continental fragmentation, dispersion and amalgamation. The continental crust is generally very thin, only about one tenth of the thickness of the tectosphere. If the rigidity and buoyancy is derived from the tectosphere, with the granitic upper crust playing only a negligible role, then supercontinent cycle may reflect the dispersion and amalgamation of the tectosphere. Therefore, supercontinent cycle may correspond to super-tectosphere cycle.},

As these demands are met from groundwater, the underground aquifers show rapidly increasing trends of depletion concomitant with seawater intrusion (SWI), which in turn is becoming a major environmental issue. In this chapter, vulnerability to seawater intrusion in the Cuddalore coastal aquifer is assessed by using the GALDIT method. This ranking- and weight-driven approach, based on various aquifer characteristics of the region, helped to determine the level of salt water intrusion in each distinct hydrological setting. Results of the study have shown that the area near the coast has been highly affected by SWI. Higher SWI in industrialized and urbanized areas is observed, suggestive of anthropogenically enhanced vulnerability. About 9.97\% of the study area falls into the high vulnerability region, and the very low vulnerability region comprises 22.03\% of the study.},

Important considerations in choosing a technique include space/time scales, range, and reliability of recharge estimates based on different techniques; other factors may limit the application of particular techniques. The goal of the recharge study is important because it may dictate the required space/time scales of the recharge estimates. Typical study goals include water-resource evaluation, which requires information on recharge over large spatial scales and on decadal time scales; and evaluation of aquifer vulnerability to contamination, which requires detailed information on spatial variability and preferential flow. The range of recharge rates that can be estimated using different approaches should be matched to expected recharge rates at a site. The reliability of recharge estimates using different techniques is variable. Techniques based on surface-water and unsaturated-zone data provide estimates of potential recharge, whereas those based on groundwater data generally provide estimates of actual recharge. Uncertainties in each approach to estimating recharge underscore the need for application of multiple techniques to increase reliability of recharge estimates.},

Groundwater depletion in the irrigated High Plains and California Central Valley accounts for {$\sim$}50\% of groundwater depletion in the United States since 1900. A newly developed High Plains recharge map shows that high recharge in the northern High Plains results in sustainable pumpage, whereas lower recharge in the central and southern High Plains has resulted in focused depletion of 330 km 3 of fossil groundwater, mostly recharged during the past 13,000 y. Depletion is highly localized with about a third of depletion occurring in 4\% of the High Plains land area. Extrapolation of the current depletion rate suggests that 35\% of the southern High Plains will be unable to support irrigation within the next 30 y. Reducing irrigation withdrawals could extend the lifespan of the aquifer but would not result in sustainable management of this fossil groundwater. The Central Valley is a more dynamic, engineered system, with north/south diversions of surface water since the 1950s contributing to {$\sim$}7xhigher recharge. However, these diversions are regulated because of impacts on endangered species. A newly developed Central Valley Hydrologic Model shows that groundwater depletion since the 1960s, totaling 80 km 3, occurs mostly in the south (Tulare Basin) and primarily during droughts. Increasing water storage through artificial recharge of excess surface water in aquifers by up to 3 km 3 shows promise for coping with droughts and improving sustainability of groundwater resources in the Central Valley.},

  abstract = {The rapid expansion of broad-band seismic networks over the last decade has paved the way for a new generation of global tomographic models. Significantly improved resolution of global upper-mantle and crustal structure can now be achieved, provided that structural information is extracted effectively from both surface and body waves and that the effects of errors in the data are controlled and minimized. Here, we present a new global, vertically polarized shear speed model that yields considerable improvements in resolution, compared to previous ones, for a variety of features in the upper mantle and crust. The model, SL2013sv, is constrained by an unprecedentedly large set of waveform fits ([{$\sim$}]3/4 of a million broad-band seismograms), computed in seismogram-dependent frequency bands, up to a maximum period range of 11-450 s. Automated multimode inversion of surface and S-wave forms was used to extract a set of linear equations with uncorrelated uncertainties from each seismogram. The equations described perturbations in elastic structure within approximate sensitivity volumes between sources and receivers. Going beyond ray theory, we calculated the phase of every mode at every frequency and its derivative with respect to S- and P-velocity perturbations by integration over a sensitivity area in a 3-D reference model; the (normally small) perturbations of the 3-D model required to fit the waveforms were then linearized using these accurate derivatives. The equations yielded by the waveform inversion of all the seismograms were simultaneously inverted for a 3-D model of shear and compressional speeds and azimuthal anisotropy within the crust and upper mantle. Elaborate outlier analysis was used to control the propagation of errors in the data (source parameters, timing at the stations, etc.). The selection of only the most mutually consistent equations exploited the data redundancy provided by our data set and strongly reduced the effect of the errors, increasing the resolution of the imaging. Our new shear speed model is parametrized on a triangular grid with a [{$\sim$}]280 km spacing. In well-sampled continental domains, lateral resolution approaches or exceeds that of regional-scale studies. The close match of known surface expressions of deep structure with the distribution of anomalies in the model provides a useful benchmark. In oceanic regions, spreading ridges are very well resolved, with narrow anomalies in the shallow mantle closely confined near the ridge axis, and those deeper, down to 100-120 km, showing variability in their width and location with respect to the ridge. Major subduction zones worldwide are well captured, extending from shallow depths down to the transition zone. The large size of our waveform fit data set also provides a strong statistical foundation to re-examine the validity field of the JWKB approximation and surface wave ray theory. Our analysis shows that the approximations are likely to be valid within certain time-frequency portions of most seismograms with high signal-to-noise ratios, and these portions can be identified using a set of consistent criteria that we apply in the course of waveform fitting.},

We find that the thickness of the oceanic lithosphere adjacent to the stretched continental margin controls, to a large degree, the shallow conductive thermal field of the entire margin. Our results confirm estimates of lithospheric thickness from seismology but contradict estimates from cooling models, which assume an equilibrium thickness of the oceanic lithosphere of 125 km. We find that the crust is colder in the oceanic than in the continental domain, whereas this trend is reversed downward. We obtain lateral temperature differences of {$\sim$}100 \{degrees\}C at 5 km depth across the margin that increase to {$\sim$}400 \{degrees\}C at 50 km depth. Higher temperatures and heat flows for the oceanic lithospheric mantle compared to the continent indicate that reduced upper-mantle P-wave velocities and densities are thermally induced.}

  abstract = {Three-dimensional laboratory models of upper mantle subduction are presented investigating the effect of the trench velocity (vt) and the slab to upper mantle viscosity ratio (SP/UM) on trench curvature and slab curvature. One set of experiments varies SP/ UM from 66 to 1375. Another set of experiments modifies vt through applying different velocities at the trailing plate. The results show that the radius of trench curvature (RTC) progressively decreases with continuous trench retreat due to quasi-toroidal mantle return flow from the subslab region around the lateral slab edges and toward the mantle wedge region, but starts to increase when trench retreat changes to trench advance due to quasi-toroidal return flow in the opposite direction. Furthermore, R TC increases with increasing SP/UM (i.e., progressively stronger slabs are progressively less curved) following a cubic root function. The force required to curve the slab and trench varies with progressive subduction, but is only 0.1-2.5\% of the total negative buoyancy force of the slab, while the viscous dissipation rate due to progressive slab curvature is only 0.01-0.60\% of the potential energy release rate. Comparison of trench curvature in the models (scaled slab width w = 750 km) with that of the Scotia subduction zone (w 800 km) indicates that for the Scotia subduction zone the effective SP/UM is of the order 1-2 {\texttimes} 10 2. Finally, the elastic sphere indentation model for arc curvature is revisited, demonstrating that four main predictions are not met by observations, implying that the model should be rejected.

  abstract = {Subduction of oceanic lithosphere occurs through both trenchward subducting plate motion and trench retreat. We investigate how subducting plate velocity, trench velocity and the partitioning of these two velocity components vary for individual subduction zone segments as a function of proximity to the closest lateral slab edge (DSE). We present a global compilation for 207 trench segments from 17 active subduction zones on Earth and three-dimensional numerical models of progressive free subduction of a single oceanic plate that subducts into a stratified mantle. The results show that the subducting plate velocity is always high ({$\geq$}5.1 cm/yr (models) and {$\geq$}4.2 cm/yr (nature)) and trench velocity is always low ({$\leq$}2.5 cm/yr (models) and {$\leq$}1.7 cm/yr (nature)) in the center of wide subduction zones (DSE {$>$} 2200 km). Only in regions close to lateral slab edges (DSE {$<$} 1000 km), be it for narrow or wide subduction zones, can the trench velocity exceed 4 cm/yr (models) and 6 cm/yr (nature) and can the subducting plate velocity go below 4 cm/yr (models) and 2 cm/yr (nature). In general, plate velocities, trench velocities and subduction partitioning are much more variable near slab edges than in the center of wide subduction zones owing to other parameters that affect subduction kinematics. We conclude that subduction kinematics can vary considerably along individual subduction zones and that the upper bound values for trench velocity and lower bound values for subducting plate velocity and subduction partitioning at individual subduction zone segments depend critically on DSE.},

  abstract = {The Southwest Pacific region is tectonically complex and is home to numerous fossil and active subduction zones. At the Earth's surface, there remains a geological controversy regarding the polarity and continuity of fossil subduction zones in New Zealand and New Caledonia, the origin of obducted ophiolites, the presence of high-pressure metamorphism, the occurrence of widespread Cenozoic magmatism, and the potential disappearance of one or more ocean basins. This controversy can be solved by looking at the lower mantle rather then at the Earth's surface. New P-wave and S-wave mantle tomography models from the Southwest Pacific are presented, which identify a previously unrecognized lower-mantle high-velocity anomaly that cannot be linked to Pacific subduction. The anomaly is located below the Tasman Sea at {$\sim$} 1100 km depth, strikes NW-SE and is {$\sim$} 2200 km by 600-900 km in lateral extent. By combining relative and absolute plate motions it is demonstrated that when the geological structures at the surface are reinterpreted as a single northeast-dipping 2500-km middle Cenozoic subduction zone (the so-called New Caledonia subduction zone) the lower mantle anomaly can be accounted for, as it is found at the predicted location and depth. Discovery of the lower mantle slab anomaly thereby solves a long-standing geological controversy in the New Zealand-New Caledonia region. Finally, reconstructions and analytical calculations predict a lower mantle slab sinking velocity of {$\sim$} 1.5 cm/yr and a lower mantle viscosity of {$\sim$} 1022 Pa{$\cdot$}s. {\copyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {With the aim of a simultaneous interpretation of elastic, anelastic and electric in situ data from the asthenosphere a comprehensive set of numerical models is developed for partial melt in different geometrical configurations. For the elastic and anelastic modulus use is made throughout of the melt squirt mechanism. Frequency dependence is not treated in detail but estimated from the limiting cases of the relaxed and unrelaxed modulus. This has the advantage that quantitative values of viscocity and flow path dimensions are not required. In the models melt can be assumed to occur in the form of tubes, films, and triaxial ellipsoidal inclusions of arbitrary aspect ratio. The conditions in which the solutions for triaxial ellipsoidal inclusions can be approximated by simpler ones for spheroidal inclusions are discussed. It is then shown up to which aspect ratio a published model on melt films is applicable. The problem of interconnection of inclusions is treated with a statistical numerical approach. It is found that a reduced degree of interconnection may have a significant influence on anelastic relaxation at melt fractions corresponding to a moderate modulus decrease. A useful representation of the anelastic melt models is introduced by plotting the relaxation strength against the effective modulus, both of which depend on the state of melting. Such diagrams allow a clear distinction between the different melt geometries and may be used for the interpretation of observed data. Finally, different melt geometries are superimposed and it is found that under certain conditions bulk dissipation may reach the order of that for shear.}

  abstract = {Groundwater modelers face the challenge of how to assign representative parameter values to the studied aquifer. Several approaches are available to parameterize spatial heterogeneity in aquifer parameters. They differ in their conceptualization and complexity, ranging from homogeneous models to heterogeneous random fields. While it is common practice to invest more effort into data collection for models with a finer resolution of heterogeneities, there is a lack of advice which amount of data is required to justify a certain level of model complexity. In this study, we propose to use concepts related to Bayesian model selection to identify this balance. We demonstrate our approach on the characterization of a heterogeneous aquifer via hydraulic tomography in a sandbox experiment (Illman et al., 2010). We consider four increasingly complex parameterizations of hydraulic conductivity: (1) Effective homogeneous medium, (2) geology-based zonation, (3) interpolation by pilot points, and (4) geostatistical random fields. First, we investigate the shift in justified complexity with increasing amount of available data by constructing a model confusion matrix. This matrix indicates the maximum level of complexity that can be justified given a specific experimental setup. Second, we determine which parameterization is most adequate given the observed drawdown data. Third, we test how the different parameterizations perform in a validation setup. The results of our test case indicate that aquifer characterization via hydraulic tomography does not necessarily require (or justify) a geostatistical description. Instead, a zonation-based model might be a more robust choice, but only if the zonation is geologically adequate. {\'O} 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Incremental emplacement of large silicic intrusions limits the size and lifetime of any magma chamber if earlier injected magma pulses solidify before the next pulse is emplaced. Geochronology indicates that long-term average magma fluxes of plutons are too low for the accumulation of magma volumes larger than a single pulse. To better constrain the formation of large-volume magma chambers, we investigate the influence of a changing emplacement rate of successive sill injections that form a composite intrusion in the upper crust. A thermal model with an explicit finite difference scheme simulates periods of transient high magma fluxes keeping the long-term average flux small. Several scenarios regarding how fluxes vary were analyzed. A progressive increase in flux does not result in magma accumulation. Only a step-like flux increase of at least one order of magnitude above the background flux produces a large magma reservoir. To generate a magma chamber of a melt-crystal mix above solidus temperature with a volume of 500--2000 km3, transient high fluxes of at least 1.25 {\texttimes} 10 - 2km3/a, equivalent to vertical, one-dimensional accretion rates of a few cm/a, are required. The transient high flux range where magma accumulates is largest for model scenarios with one period of transient high flux, and therefore, this emplacement style is favored for the built-up of substantial magma chambers during pluton growth. Intrusion scenarios with three and four periods of transient high fluxes do not generate reservoirs of mobile magma, but magma mushes can be present for some hundred thousand years.},

  abstract = {Simple thermal models based on the creation and cooling of the lithosphere can account for the observed subsidence of the ocean floor and the measured decreased in heat flow with age. In well-sedimented areas, where there is little loss of heat due to hydrothermal circulation, the surface heat flow decays uniformly from values in excess of 6 {\textmu}cal/cm{$^2$} s (250 mW/m{$^2$}), for crust younger than 4 Ma (4 m.y. B.P.), to close to 1.1 {\textmu}cal/cm{$^2$} s (46 mW/m{$^2$}) through crust between 120 and 140 Ma. After 200 Ma the heat flow is predicted to reach an equilibrium value of 0.9 {\textmu}cal/cm{$^2$} s (38 mW/m{$^2$}). The surface heat flow on continents is controlled by many phenomena. On the time scale of geological periods the most important of these are the last orogenic event, the distribution of heat-producing elements, and erosion. To better understand the effects of age, each continent is separated into four provinces on the basis of radiometric dates. Reflecting the preponderance of Precambrian crust, two of these provinces cover the Archean to the middle Proterozoic, and the third covers the late Proterozoic to the Mesozoic. The mean heat flow decreases from a value of 1.84 {\textmu}cal/cm{$^2$} s (77 mW/m{$^2$}) for the youngest province to a constant value of 1.1 {\textmu}cal/cm{$^2$} s (46 mW/m{$^2$}) after 800 Ma. The nonradiogenic component of the surface heat flow decays to a constant value of between 0.65 and 0.5 {\textmu}cal/cm{$^2$} s (25 and 21 mW/m{$^2$}) within 200--400 Ma. Using theoretical models, we compute the heat loss through the oceans to be 727 {\texttimes} 1010 cal/s (30.4 {\texttimes} 1012 W). The comparison between the theoretical and measured values allows an estimate of 241 {\texttimes} 1010 cal/s (10.1 {\texttimes} 1012 W) for the heat lost owing to hydrothermal circulation. We show that the heat flow through the marginal basins follows the same relation as that for crust created at a midocean spreading center. These basins have a corresponding heat loss of 71 {\texttimes} 1010 cal/s (3.0 {\texttimes} 1012 W). The heat loss through the continents is calculated from the observations and is 208 {\texttimes} 1010 cal/s (8.8 {\texttimes} 1012 W). Our estimate of the value for the shelves is 67 {\texttimes} 1010 cal/s (2.8 {\texttimes} 1012 W). The total heat loss of the earth is 1002 {\texttimes} 1010 cal/s (42.0 {\texttimes} 1012 W), of which 70\% is through the deep oceans and marginal basins and 30\% through the continents and continental shelves. The creation of lithosphere accounts for just under 90\% of the heat lost through the oceans and hence about 60\% of the worldwide heat loss. Convective processes, which include plate creation and orogeny on continents, dissipate two thirds of the heat lost by the earth. Conduction through the lithosphere is responsible for 20\%, and the rest is lost by the radioactive decay of the continental and oceanic crust. We place bounds of between 0.6 and 0.9 {\textmu}cal/cm{$^2$} s (25 and 38 mW/m{$^2$}) for the mantle heat flow beneath an ocean at equilibrium and between 0.40 and 0.75 {\textmu}cal/cm{$^2$} s (17 and 31 mW/m{$^2$}) for the heat flow beneath an old stable continent. The computed range of geotherms for an equilibrium ocean overlaps the range of stable continental geotherms below a depth of 100 km. The mantle heat flow beneath a continent decays with a thermal time constant similar to that of the oceanic lithosphere. The continental basins subside with the same time constant. These observations are evidence that there is no detectable difference between the thermal structure of an equilibrium ocean and that of an old continent. Thus the concept of the lithosphere as a combination of a mechanical and a thermal boundary layer can be applied to both oceans and continents. We evaluate the constraints placed on models based on this concept by seismological observations. In the absence of compelling evidence to the contrary we favor these models because they provide a single explanation for the thermal structure of the lithosphere beneath an equilibrium ocean and a stable continent.},

Rodinia formed during the Grenville Event (c. 1100 Ma) and remained intact until its collision with the Congo continent (800-750 Ma). This collision closed the southern part of the Mozambique Seaway, and triggered the break-up of Rodinia. The Panthalassic Ocean opened as the supercontinent of Rodinia split into a northern half (East Gondwana, Cathaysia and Cimmeria) and a southern half (Laurentia, Amazonia-NW Africa, Baltica, and Siberia). Over the next 150 Ma, North Rodinia rotated counter-clockwise over the North Pole, while South Rodinia rotated clockwise across the South Pole. In the latest Precambrian (650-550 Ma), the three Neoproterozoic continents--North Rodinia, South Rodinia and the Congo continents--collided during the Pan-Africa Event forming the second Neoproterozoic supercontinent, Pannotia (Greater Gondwanaland). Pan-African mountain building and the fall in sea level associated with the assembly of Pannotia may have triggered the extreme Ice House conditions that characterize the middle and late Neoproterozoic. Although the palaeogeographic maps presented here do not prohibit a Snowball Earth, the mapped extent of Neoproterozoic ice sheets favour a bipolar Ice House World with a broad expanse of ocean at the equator. Soon after it was assembled (c. 560 Ma), Pannotia broke apart into the four principal Palaeozoic continents: Laurentia (North America), Baltica (northern Europe), Siberia and Gondwana. The amalgamation and subsequent break-up of Pannotia may have triggered the "Cambrian Explosion". The first economically important accumulations of hydrocarbons are from Neoproterozoic sources. The two major source rocks of this age (Nepa of Siberia and Huqf of Oman) occur in association with massive Neoproterozoic evaporite deposits and in the warm equatorial-subtropical belt, within 30 degrees of the equator.},

A quadratic heater placed between two cubic samples generates a rectangular heat pulse of 5 s length. In one of the cubes the pulse response at a known distance from the heater is measured by a thermocouple. The sample holder is mounted on the upper plug of the used high pressure vessel. The whole sample arrangement is sealed against the pressure medium by an elastic polyurethene jacket. Pore fluid is introduced into the pore space of the rock sample by a perforated back plate. A numerical modelling of the pulse propagation is used to determine thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity from the measured pulse amplitude and half value time.

For the same rocks the elastic wave velocities were determined up to 500 MPa. The results show two types of behaviour depending on the pressure. At low pressures a strong nonlinear increase of the petrophysical parameters is observed. A transition to a much weaker linear pressure dependence is found at larger pressures. Whereas the low pressure range extends for the elastic properties to pressures up to the order of about 150 MPa, the linear pressure dependence for the thermal parameters is reached at pressures smaller than 50 MPa. The observed difference in the high pressure behaviour is explained with respect to airfilling and scattering centres for phonons and the behaviour of the contacts between the crack faces for elastic wave propagation.}

To estimate the heat flow, an available zone was selected from a geologic section observed in a well. The selected zone is covered by many bottom-hole temperatures sufficient to determine a reliable geothermal gradient. The bottom-hole temperature was converted into an equilibrium formation temperature mainly by using the simple equation obtained from the relations between bottom-hole and reservoir temperatures. The thermal conductivity of the zone was primarily determined by both the measurements of well-core samples and the experimental relations of thermal conductivity to porosity of some specific rocks. The conductivity was adjusted to subsurface temperature by using the empirical equation deduced from the relations of thermal conductivities of materials to temperatures.--Modified journal abstract.},

  abstract = {The determination of ground surface temperature history (GSTH) from present borehole temperature defines an ill-posed inverse problem for which the required regularization must reflect the stochastic properties of both measurement noise and ground surface temperature. The timescales of interest in the study of climate changes range from a few decades to hundreds of thousands of years. This makes climate a very broad-banded process. This paper presents a multiple-scale stochastic prior model for GSTH, which overcomes several problems in previous commonly applied single-scale modes of regularization. The von Karmann power-law stochastic processes come out as special cases. Should other information warrant uneven prior variation bounds on different frequency intervals, the multiple-scale formulation can readily incorporate this. The practical computation of the prior covariances between past temperature node values is achieved through an elementary function space projection formulation. This projection approach is generally applicable for arbitrary base functions underlying the discretization. The superior robustness of this multiple-scale prior model is demonstrated by comparison to previously used single-scale models for the classic test case by Beck (1977) where the multiple-scale prior model allows simultaneous estimation of temperature history from decade scale to glaciation scale. Moreover, the function space projection method ensures that GSTH estimates are insensitive to discretization, provided that discretization is finer than the inherent resolution limit. A test on two very different experimental data sets confirms the merits of the proposed stochastic model. For maximum consistency between GSTH estimates across timescales, borehole depths scales and groups of investigators, we propose that a covariance function with a uniform variance of (5 K)2 per frequency decade be used as a standard prior for inverse ground surface temperature history problems.},

  abstract = {Global plate motion models provide a spatial and temporal framework for geological data and have been effective tools for exploring processes occurring at the earth's surface. However, published models either have insufficient temporal coverage or fail to treat tectonic plates in a self-consistent manner. They usually consider the motions of selected features attached to tectonic plates, such as continents, but generally do not explicitly account for the continuous evolution of plate boundaries through time. In order to explore the coupling between the surface and mantle, plate models are required that extend over at least a few hundred million years and treat plates as dynamic features with dynamically evolving plate boundaries. We have constructed a new type of global plate motion model consisting of a set of continuously-closing topological plate polygons with associated plate boundaries and plate velocities since the break-up of the supercontinent Pangea. Our model is underpinned by plate motions derived from reconstructing the seafloor-spreading history of the ocean basins and motions of the continents and utilizes a hybrid absolute reference frame, based on a moving hotspot model for the last 100. Ma, and a true-polar wander corrected paleomagnetic model for 200 to 100. Ma. Detailed regional geological and geophysical observations constrain plate boundary inception or cessation, and time-dependent geometry. Although our plate model is primarily designed as a reference model for a new generation of geodynamic studies by providing the surface boundary conditions for the deep earth, it is also useful for studies in disparate fields when a framework is needed for analyzing and interpreting spatio-temporal data. {\copyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Empirical methods use data from in situ field tests to derive the relationship between depth and permeability by applying a curve-fitting method and establishing the relationship between hydraulic conductivity and a geological index. Analytical methods rely on Darcy and cubic laws to estimate the permeability of a rock mass by taking into account the geometrical characteristics of the joint sets. Analytical equations of the flow rate into underground excavations are also developed by solving the Laplace equation for homogeneous and isotropic aquifers under various boundary conditions. Numerical modeling can evaluate the outcomes of both empirical and analytical approaches (and vice versa) and can provide a sensitivity analysis of the parameters that affect rock mass permeability. The importance of stress and joint set characteristics is often investigated via numerical modeling, as are the scale effect and directional permeability. In this review paper, we provide a comprehensive review of these approaches for studying rock mass permeability. We summarize the advantages and disadvantages of existing methods and highlight potential future research directions.},

  abstract = {In mantle convection simulations, dynamically evolving plate boundaries have, for the most part, been represented using an visco-plastic flow law. These systems develop fine-scale, localized, weak shear band structures which are reminiscent of faults but it is a significant challenge to resolve the large- and the emergent, small-scale-behavior. We address this issue of resolution by taking into account the observation that a rock element with embedded, planar, failure surfaces responds as a non-linear, transversely isotropic material with a weak orientation defined by the plane of the failure surface. This approach partly accounts for the large-scale behavior of fine-scale systems of shear bands which we are not in a position to resolve explicitly. We evaluate the capacity of this continuum approach to model plate boundaries, specifically in the context of subduction models where the plate boundary interface has often been represented as a planar discontinuity. We show that the inclusion of the transversely isotropic plasticity model for the plate boundary promotes asymmetric subduction from initiation. A realistic evolution of the plate boundary interface and associated stresses is crucial to understanding inter-plate coupling, convergent margin driven topography, and earthquakes.},

  abstract = {Geologic and geophysical observations indicate that the thickness, density, and strength of the lithosphere vary on the Earth. However, the role of the overriding plate lithosphere properties on the evolution and morphology of subduction is not well understood. This paper presents time-dependent numerical models of subduction that vary the overriding plate thickness, strength, and density and allow for a plate interface that evolves with time via an anisotropic brittle failure rheology. We examine the effect of these parameters on subduction evolution, in particular, the emergence of (a) asymmetric versus symmetric subduction, (b) trench retreat versus advance, (c) subduction zone geometry, (d) slab stagnation versus penetration into the lower mantle, and (e) flat slab subduction. Almost all of the models presented result in sustained asymmetric subduction from initiation. Trench advance occurs in models with a thick and or strong overriding plate. Slab dip, measured at a depth below the plate boundary interface, has a negative correlation with an increase in overriding plate thickness. Overriding plate thickness exerts a first-order control over slab penetration into the lower mantle, with penetration most commonly occurring in models with a thick overriding plate. Periods of flat slab subduction occur with thick, strong overriding plates producing strong plate boundary interface coupling. The results provide insight into how the overriding plate plays a role in establishing advancing and retreating subduction as well as providing an explanation for the variation of slab geometry across subduction zones on Earth, where similar patterns of evolution are observed.},

  abstract = {AbstractExtension of the Earth's crust can result in differing styles of rifting, such as horst-and-graben, half-graben, metamorphic core complexes and areas of distributed crustal thinning. Faulting patterns can range from either being distributed to highly localized. Observations indicate that the factors controlling the extensional deformation, symmetry, and fault spacing include rheological aspects such as the yielding mechanism and strain softening, and physical aspects such as initial heterogeneities and the strength of the lower crust compared to the upper crust. Time-dependent numerical models of extension are presented, which investigate the influence of the yielding mechanism, lower crust strength, strain weakening, and initial heterogeneity in the crust have on (a) the style of rifting, (b) fault spacing, and (c) integrated strength in the upper crust. Models with an anisotropic yielding mechanism result in more realistic lithospheric strength profiles, slip plane angle distributions, and fault interaction than models with an isotropic yielding mechanism. Heterogeneity type and yielding mechanisms have the largest effect on the resulting symmetry of deformation, whereas the amount of strain weakening has the greatest influence on asymmetry. The likelihood of the metamorphic core complex mode occurring is primarily controlled by lower crust strength. Crustal thinning is encouraged by both low amounts of strain weakening and a strong lower crust. Lower crust viscosity exerts the primary control on whether the resulting deformation is distributed or localized. The degree of strain weakening has the largest influence on the average strength of the upper crust and the slope of the strength profile in the upper crust.},

We have used the obtained temperature-depth (T-z) data and the thermal property measurements to estimate the ground surface temperature (GST) histories and the heat flow densities at these sites, using a least squares inverse method. The method employs the theory of heat conduction in a laterally homogeneous Earth and the concept of incorporating a priori information to stabilize and uniquely determine the solution. We formulate the least squares optimization problem in the functional spaces and solve it with a quasi-Newton iterative gradient method. The functional space formulation allows the gradient operator to be obtained by solving only forward problems and the quasi-Newton method, which has a second order convergence, allows the a posteriori covariance operator to be readily computed. Except for the Cochrane hole, where systematic errors appear to exist in the temperature measurements, the two T-z logs for each hole, whether inverted individually or simultaneously, yield highly consistent, though not identical, results. All of the estimated GST histories, except that for Otoskwin River, exhibit a broad low centered around 1800 A.D. (the Little Ice Age), preceeded by a warm period in the Mid-Holocene (the Little Climatic Optimum) and followed by a warming trend in the last 100 years. However, the GST histories differ significantly from hole to hole in terms of the amplitude and the timing of their temporal variations. This suggests that the T-z data may have been significantly perturbed by local topography, lateral heterogeneities in the subsurface thermal properties, groundwater circulation, etc., which are not taken into account in the theory of one-dimensional heat conduction. {\copyright} 1992.},

The geoscience community is increasingly utilizing seismic tomography to interpret mantle heterogeneity and its links to past tectonic and geodynamic processes. To assess the robustness and distribution of positive seismic anomalies, inferred as subducted slabs, we create a set of vote maps for the lower mantle with 14 global P-wave or S-wave tomography models. Based on a depth-dependent threshold metric, an average of 20\% of any given tomography model depth is identified as a potential slab. However, upon combining the 14 models, the most consistent positive wavespeed features are identified by an increasing vote count. An overall peak in the most robust anomalies is found between 1000-1400 km depth, followed by a decline to a minimum around 2000 km. While this trend could reflect reduced tomographic resolution in the middle mantle, we show that it may alternatively relate to real changes in the time-dependent subduction flux and/or a mid-lower mantle viscosity increase. An apparent secondary peak in agreement below 2500 km depth may reflect the degree-Two lower mantle slow seismic structures. Vote maps illustrate the potential shortcomings of using a limited number or type of tomography models and slab threshold criteria.}

  abstract = {Absolute reference frames are a means of describing the motion of plates on the surface of the Earth over time, relative to a fixed point or "frame." Multiple models of absolute plate motion have been proposed for the Cretaceous-Tertiary period, however, estimating the robustness and limitations of each model remains a significant limitation for refining both regional and global models of plate motion as well as fully integrated and time dependent geodynamic models. Here, we use a novel approach to compare five models of absolute plate motion in terms of their consequences for forward modelled deep mantle structure since at least 140. Ma. We show that the use of hotspots, either fixed or moving, or palaeomagnetics, with or without corrections for true-polar wander, leads to significant differences in palaeo-plate velocities of over 10. cm/yr as well as differences in the location of palaeo-plate boundaries of up to 30{$^\circ$} in longitude and latitude. Furthermore, we suggest that first order differences in forward predicted mantle structure between the models are due mostly to differences in palaeo-plate velocities, whereas variation in the location of plate boundaries may contribute to smaller wavelength offsets. We present a global comparison of the absolute reference frames in terms of mantle structure, which we have tomographically filtered to reflect the resolution of the seismic tomography model S20RTS. At very long wavelengths hotspot models best reproduce the mantle structure. However, when geometry and the match of smaller-scale subducted slab volumes are compared, a hybrid model based on moving hotspots after 100. Ma and palaeomagnetic data before (with no corrections for true-polar wander), best reproduces the overall mantle structure of slab burial grounds, even though no single model fits best at all mantle depths. We find also that the published subduction reference frame tested here results in a modelled mantle structure that agrees well with S20RTS for depths {\textbackslash}textgreater 2500. km, equivalent to subduction before the Cretaceous, but not for shallower depths. This indicates that a careful assimilation of hotspot, palaeomagnetic and seismic tomography data into future absolute plate motion models is required to derive a more robust subduction reference frame. {\copyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Subduction zones worldwide exhibit remarkable variation in seismic activity over short distances of about tens of kilometres along their length. The properties of the subducting oceanic plate are believed to influence this seismic behaviour. However, comparisons between seismicity and plate attributes such as thermal structure made over large scales of hundreds of kilometres typically yield poor correlations. Here we present results from controlled-source seismic data collected offshore of the Alaska Peninsula. We find that fabric in the subducting oceanic plate-the orientation and style of remnant faults originally created at the mid-ocean ridge-can contribute to abrupt changes in faulting and hydration of the plate during bending before subduction. Variations in fabric, bending faulting and hydration correlate with changes in seismicity throughout the subduction zone. More interplate and intermediate-depth intraplate earthquakes are observed where the pre-existing fabric is aligned with the trench and there is more bend faulting and hydration. This suggests that pre-existing structures in the subducting plate are an important control on abrupt variations in deformation and plate hydration and on globally observed short-wavelength variations in seismicity at subduction zones.}

In both cases, the interpretation model is a set of vertical rectangular 2D prisms whose thicknesses are parameters to be estimated and that represent the depth to the interface separating sediments and basement. The solutions to both problems are stable because of the incorporation of additional prior information about the smoothness of the estimated relief and the depth to the basement at a few locations, presumably provided by boreholes. The method was tested with synthetic gravity anomalies produced by simulated sedimentary basins with smooth relief, providing not only well-resolved estimated relief, but also good estimates for the density contrasts at the surface and for the decaying factors of the density contrast with depth. The method was applied to the Bouguer anomaly from Rec{\^o}ncavo Basin, estimating the surface density contrast and the decaying factor of the density contrast with depth s-0.30 g/cm3 and 30km, respectively. {\copyright} 2006 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.},

  abstract = {The Beaufort-Mackenzie Basin was initiated in the Early Jurassic as part of an Arctic rifted passive continental margin which soon after became overprinted by Cordilleran foreland tectonics. Decades of industrial exploration and scientific research in this petroliferous region have produced a wide spectrum of geological and geophysical data as well as geoscientific knowledge. We have integrated available grids of sedimentary horizons, well data, seismic reflection and refraction data, and the observed regional gravity field into the first crust-scale 3D structural model of the Beaufort-Mackenzie Basin. Many characteristics of this model reflect the complex geodynamic and tectonostratigraphic history of the basin.The Mesozoic-Cenozoic sedimentary part of the model comprises seven clastic units (predominantly sandy shales) of which the modelled thickness distributions allow to retrace the well-established history of the basin comprising a gradual north(east)ward shift of the main depocentres as well as diverse phases of localised erosion. As a result of this development, the present-day configuration of the basin reveals that the sedimentary units tend to be younger, more porous, and thus less dense towards the north at a constant depth level.By integrating three refraction seismic profiles and performing combined isostatic and 3D gravity modelling, we have modelled the sub-sedimentary basement of the Beaufort-Mackenzie Basin. The continental basement spans from unstretched domains (as thick as about 42km) in the south to extremely thinned domains (of less than 5km thickness) in the north where it probably represents transitional crust attached to the oceanic crust of the Canada Basin. The uppermost parts of the continental crust are less dense ({$\rho$}=2710kg/m3) and most probably made up by pre-Mesozoic meta-sediments overlying a heavier igneous and metamorphic crust ({$\rho$}=2850kg/m3).The presented crust-scale 3D structural model shows that the greatest thicknesses of Mesozoic-Cenozoic sediments (almost 17. km) are not found in the north where the sub-sedimentary crust is thinnest, but farther south where the crust is thicker and the Moho quite deep. We causally relate the huge amounts of foredeep deposits overlying a Moho depression to a flexural response of the lithosphere to orogenic loading induced by the Brooks Range orogen in the south. Our 3D model provides an ideal base and reference for future numerical studies including reconstructions of the development from a passive margin to a foreland basin and simulations of the present-day thermal field of the basin. {\copyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Significant lateral variations in observed temperatures in the Beaufort-Mackenzie Basin raise the question on the temperature-controlling factors. Based on the structural configuration of the sediments and underlying crust in the area, we calculate the steady-state 3D conductive thermal field. Integrated data include the base of the relic permafrost layer representing the 0 {$^\circ$}C-isotherm, public-domain temperature data (from 227 wells) and thermal conductivity data. For {\textbackslash}textgreater75\% of the wells the predicted temperatures deviate by {\textbackslash}textless10 K from the observed temperatures, which validates the overall model setup and adopted thermal properties. One important trend reproduced by the model is a decrease in temperatures from the western to the eastern basin. While in the west, a maximum temperature of 185 {$^\circ$}C is reached at 5000 m below sea level, in the east the maximum temperature is 138 {$^\circ$}C. The main cause for this pattern lies in lateral variations in thermal conductivity indicating differences in the shale and sand contents of the different juxtaposed sedimentary units. North-to-south temperature trends reveal the superposition of deep and shallow effects. At the southern margin, where the insulating effect of the low-conductive sediments is missing, temperatures are lowest. Farther north, where the sub-sedimentary continental crust is thick enough to produce considerable heat and a thick pile of sediments efficiently stores heat, temperatures tend to be highest. Temperatures decrease again towards the northernmost distal parts of the basin, where thinned continental and oceanic crust produce less radiogenic heat. Wells with larger deviations of the purely conductive model from the temperature observations ({\textbackslash}textgreater15 K at 10\% of the wells) and their basin-wide pattern of misfit tendency (too cold vs. too warm temperature predictions) point to a locally restricted coupling of heat transport to groundwater flow.}

  abstract = {{\textbackslash}textlessp{\textbackslash}textgreaterWe present 3D models that describe the present-day thermal and rheological state of the lithosphere of the greater Kenya Rift region aiming at a better understanding of the rift evolution, with a particular focus on plume-lithosphere interactions. The key methodology applied is the 3D integration of diverse geological and geophysical observations using gravity modelling. Accordingly, the resulting lithospheric-scale 3D density model is consistent with (i) reviewed descriptions of lithological variations in the sedimentary and volcanic cover, (ii) known trends in crust and mantle seismic velocities as revealed by seismic and seismological data, and (iii) the observed gravity field. This data-based model is the first to image a 3D density configuration of the crystalline crust for the entire region of Kenya and northern Tanzania. An Upper and a Basal Crustal Layer are differentiated, each composed of several domains of different average densities. We interpret these domains to trace back to the Precambrian terrane amalgamation associated with the East African Orogen and to magmatic processes during Mesozoic and Cenozoic rifting phases. In combination with seismic velocities, the densities of these crustal domains are indicative of compositional differences. The derived lithological trends have been used to parameterize steady-state thermal and rheological models. These models indicate that crustal and mantle temperatures decrease from the Kenya Rift in the west to eastern Kenya, while the integrated strength of the lithosphere increases. Thereby, the detailed strength configuration appears strongly controlled by the complex inherited crustal structure, which may have been decisive for the onset, localisation, and propagation of rifting.{\textbackslash}textless/p{\textbackslash}textgreater}

  abstract = {Adjoint models are used for atmospheric and oceanic sensitivity studies in order to efficiently evaluate the sensitivity of a cost function (e.g., the temperature or pressure at some target time t(f), averaged over some region of interest) with respect to the three-dimensional model initial conditions. The time-dependent sensitivity, that is the sensitivity to initial conditions as function of the initial time t(i), may be obtained directly and most efficiently from the adjoint model solution. There are two approaches to formulating an adjoint of a given model. In the first (''finite difference of adjoint''), one derives the continuous adjoint equations from the linearized continuous forward model equations and then formulates the finite-difference implementation of the continuous adjoint equations. In the second (''adjoint of finite difference''), one derives the finite-difference adjoint equations directly from the finite difference of the forward model. It is shown here that the time-dependent sensitivity obtained by using the second approach may result in a very strong nonphysical behavior such as a large-amplitude two-time-step leapfrog computational mode, which may prevent the solution from being used for time-dependent sensitivity studies. This is an especially relevant problem now, as this second approach is the one used by automatic adjoint compilers that are becoming widely used. The two approaches are analyzed in detail using both a simple model and the adjoint of a primitive equations ocean general circulation model. It is emphasized that both approaches are valid as long as they are used for obtaining the gradient or sensitivity at a single time, as needed in data assimilation, for example. Criteria are presented for the choice of the appropriate adjoint formulation for a given problem.}

  abstract = {Subduction is substantially multiscale process where the stresses are built by long-term tectonic motions, modified by sudden jerky deformations during earthquakes, and then restored by following multiple relaxation processes. Here we develop a cross-scale thermomechanical model aimed to simulate the subduction process from 1 min to million years' time scale. The model employs elasticity, nonlinear transient viscous rheology, and rate-and-state friction. It generates spontaneous earthquake sequences and by using an adaptive time step algorithm, recreates the deformation process as observed naturally during the seismic cycle and multiple seismic cycles. The model predicts that viscosity in the mantle wedge drops by more than three orders of magnitude during the great earthquake with a magnitude above 9. As a result, the surface velocities just an hour or day after the earthquake are controlled by viscoelastic relaxation in the several hundred km of mantle landward of the trench and not by the afterslip localized at the fault as is currently believed. Our model replicates centuries-long seismic cycles exhibited by the greatest earthquakes and is consistent with the postseismic surface displacements recorded after the Great Tohoku Earthquake. We demonstrate that there is no contradiction between extremely low mechanical coupling at the subduction megathrust in South Chile inferred from long-term geodynamic models and appearance of the largest earthquakes, like the Great Chile 1960 Earthquake.},

The Voronoi-cell finite difference (VFD) method realizes a discrete Laplacian operator based on Voronoi cells and their natural neighbors, featuring high adaptivity and simplicity. To resolve multicenter Coulomb singularity in all-electron calculations of polyatomic molecules, this method utilizes highly adaptive molecular grids which consist of spherical atomic grids. It provides accurate and efficient solutions for the Schr{\"o}dinger equation and the Poisson equation with the all-electron Coulomb potentials regardless of the coordinate system and the molecular symmetry. For numerical examples, we assess accuracy of the VFD method for electronic structures of one-electron polyatomic systems, and apply the method to the density-functional theory for many-electron polyatomic molecules. {\copyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

Recently published structural and stratigraphic evidence from Britain, Scandinavia, East Greenland and Newfoundland is reviewed and shows that Western Avalonia, Eastern Avalonia and Baltica all docked sinistrally against Laurentia in the Silurian.Western Avalonia collided sinistrally against the previously accreted Gander and Dunnage arc terranes on the Appalachian margin of Laurentia in mid-Silurian time and then shifted dextrally during the Acadian orogeny in the Devonian. Oblique collision of Baltica with the Greenland margin induced southeasterly crustal stacking in the Scandian orogen and sinistral transpression in the NE Greenland Caledonides, and was followed by more nearly orthogonal convergence. Eastern Avalonia underwent anticlockwise with the Scottish `corner' of Laurentia, rotating into a re-entrant between Laurentia and Baltica.Some implications of this Silurian closure model are that convergence in the Tornquist zone was modest at that time, and that the Acadian (Devonian) deformation in the northern Appalahians and Britain had a subsequent external cause, most likely the impingement of Armorica and Iberia due to the northward drift of Gondwana.},

The anhydrous pelite solidus is between 1,150 and 1,200{$^\circ$}C at 3.0 GPa and close to 1,250{$^\circ$}C at 5.0 GPa, whereas the liquidus is likely to be at 1,600{$^\circ$}C or higher at all investigated pressures, giving a large melting interval of over 400{$^\circ$}C. The subsolidus paragenesis consists of quartz/coesite, feldspar, garnet, kyanite, rutile, {\textpm}clinopyroxene {\textpm}apatite. Feldspar, rutile and apatite are rapidly melted out above the solidus, whereas garnet and kyanite are stable to high melt fractions ({\textbackslash}textgreater70\%). Clinopyroxene stability increases with increasing pressure, and quartz/coesite is the sole liquidus phase at all pressures. Feldspars are relatively Na-rich [K/(K + Na) = 0.4-0.5] at3.0 GPa, but are nearly pure K-feldspar at 5. 0 GPa. Clinopyroxenes are jadeite and Ca-eskolaite rich, with jadeite contents increasing with pressure. All supersolidus experiments produced alkaline dacitic melts with relatively constant SiO2 and Al2O3 contents. At 3.0 GPa, initial melting is controlled almost exclusively by feldspar and quartz, giving melts with K2O/Na2O {$\sim$}1. At 4.0 and 5.0 GPa, low-fraction melting is controlled by jadeite-rich clinopyroxene and K-rich feldspar, which leads to compatible behaviour of Na and melts with K2O/Na2O {$\gg$} 1. Our results indicate that sedimentary protoliths entrained in upwelling heterogeneous mantle domains may undergo melting at greater depths than mafic lithologies to produce ultrapotassic dacitic melts. Such melts are expected to react with and metasomatise the surrounding peridotite, which may subsequently undergo melting at shallower levels to produce compositionally distinct magma types. This scenario may account for many of the distinctive geochemical characteristics of EM-type ocean island magma suites. Moreover, unmelted or partially melted sedimentary rocks in the mantle may contribute to some seismic discontinuities that have been observed beneath intraplate and island-arc volcanic regions. {\copyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

These geoid lows have been attributed to Mesozoic subduction. Geodynamic models that include slab graveyards in the lower mantle as inferred from seismic topography or from plate reconstructions correctly predict the general trend of geoid minima. However, these models fail to accurately reproduce localized geoid lows in the Indian Ocean, Ross Sea and northeast Pacific Ocean. Here we show that the geoid lows are correlated with high-velocity anomalies near the base of the mantle and low-velocity anomalies in the mid-to-upper mantle. Our mantle flow models reproduce the geoid minima if the mid-to-upper mantle upwellings are positioned above the inferred locations of ancient subducted slabs. We find that the long-wavelength trough in the geoid is linked to high-density slab graveyards in the lower mantle, whereas upwelling regions in the mantle above 1,000 km depth cause discrete lows within the larger trough. We suggest that this mode of upwelling in the mid-to-upper mantle is caused by buoyant hydrated mantle that was created by processes around and above subducted slabs. {\copyright} 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

We analysed both the aeromagnetic residuals of northern Italy gathered by Agip (now Eni) and the recent EMAG2 compilation. We used the centroid method on 44 and 96 (respectively) 100 {\texttimes} 100 km2 windows considering both a random and a fractal magnetization distribution, but found that, at least for the Alps, the fractal model yields unrealistically shallow CPDs. Analyses considering a random magnetization model give CPDs varying between 12 and 39 km (22 to 24 km on average considering the two data sets) in the Po Plain, representing the Adriatic-African foreland area of the Alps, in substantial agreement with recently reported heat flow values of 60--70 mW/m2. In the Alps, the Eni data set yields shallow CPDs ranging between 6 and 23 km (13 km on average). EMAG2 analysis basically confirms the ``hot'' Alpine crust, but reduces it to three 50--100 km wide patches elongated along the chain, where CPDs vary between 10 and 15 km. Such ``hot'' Alpine domains occur just north of maximum (50--55 km) crustal thickness zones of the Alps and correspond to low seismic wave velocity anomalies recently documented in the 20--22 to 35--38 km depth interval, whereas no relation is apparent with local geology. Assuming an average crustal thermal conductivity of 2.5 W/m {$^\circ$}C and a steady-state conductive model, CPDs from the hot zones of the Alps translate into heat flow values of 110--120 mW/m2, and to a basal heat flow from the mantle exceeding 100 mW/m2 that is significantly greater than that expected in a mountain range. Thus we conclude that the steady-state conductive model does not apply for the Alps and granitic melts occur at {$\sim$}15--40 km depths, consistently with seismic tomography evidence.},

We show that the hybrid scheme is identical to the two end-member schemes in the limit of infinite and zero Peclet number and remains accurate over a wide range of Peclet numbers. This scheme does not have a CFL stability criterion allowing the choice of time step to be decoupled from the spatial resolution. We compare numerical results with an analytic solution and test both an operator split version of our method and a combined version that solves advection and diffusion simultaneously. We also compare results of simple explicit and implicit numerical schemes and show that the semi-Lagrangian Crank-Nicolson (SLCN) scheme is both faster and more accurate on the same problem. We then apply the combined SLCN scheme to a more geologically relevant benchmark for calculating the thermal structure of a subduction zone. This problem demonstrates that the SLCN scheme can remain stable and accurate at large Courant numbers even in flows with highly curved streamlines. Finally, we introduce a variable order interpolation scheme for the semi-Lagrangian schemes that reduces interpolation artifacts for sharp fronts without introducing numerical diffusion.},

  abstract = {Plasticity/failure is an essential ingredient in geodynamics models as earth materials cannot sustain unbounded stresses. However, many questions remain as to appropriate models of plasticity as well as effective solvers for these strongly nonlinear systems. Here we present some simplified model problems designed to elucidate many of the issues involved for the description and solution of viscoplastic problems as currently used in geodynamic modeling. We consider compression and extension of a viscoplastic layer overlying an isoviscous layer and introduce a single plastic yield criterion which includes the most commonly used viscoplasticity models: von Mises, depth-dependent von Mises, and Drucker-Prager. We show that for all rheologies considered, successive substitution schemes (aka Picard iteration) often stall at large values of the nonlinear residual, producing spurious solutions. However, combined Picard-Newton schemes can be effective for rheologies that are independent of the dynamic pressure. Difficulties arise when solving incompressible Stokes problems for rheologies that depend on the dynamic pressure such as DruckerPrager viscoplasticity. Analysis suggests that incompressible Stokes can become ill-posed when the dependence of the deviatoric stress tensor on dynamic pressure (i.e., j@s=@p0j) becomes large. We demonstrate empirically that, in these cases, Newton solvers can fail by introducing spurious shear bands and discuss the consequence of interpreting the results of nonconverged computations. Even for problems where solvers converge, Drucker-Prager viscoplasticity can produce dynamic pressures that deviate significantly from lithostatic and both the velocity and pressure fields should be evaluated to determine whether solutions are geologically reasonable.},

These marked differences in the magmatic - stratigraphic associations of the Early Cambrian basalts in Victoria have led to highly varied interpretations of their tectonic setting, which include subduction zones that are east-dipping, west-dipping and even a combination of east- and west-dipping systems. Here, we present new geochemical data for Cambrian basalts from the Stawell Zone and reassess the palaeogeographic and palaeotectonic setting of the region. Our geochemical data show that basalts in the Stawell Zone may be broadly divided into two units: basalts that are LREE-depleted relative to N-MORB and have low (\&le3.0 ppm) Nb contents; and basalts that are slightly LREE-enriched relative to N-MORB and have relatively high ({\textbackslash}textgreater3.0 ppm) Nb contents. The LREE-depleted Nb-poor basalts are the most abundant type in the Stawell Zone and generally occur at lower stratigraphic levels than the Nb-rich basalts. While the slightly LREE-enriched basalts are most similar to the backarc-basin basalts in the Heathcote and Mt Wellington Greenstone Belts, all basalts from the Stawell Zone display characteristics similar to modern backarc-basin basalts from the West Pacific. We propose that basaltic magmatism in the Stawell Zone was generated during a widespread backarc extension event that affected much of western Victoria. However, important stratigraphic - magmatic associations in the Stawell Zone, including the absence of forearc-generated boninites and the presence of a thick ({\textbackslash}textgreater300 m) package of quartz-rich sandstone and mudstone underlying the Early Cambrian basalts, indicate that the Stawell Zone was relatively close to (or possibly at the outer margins of) the East Gondwanan continental margin and thus always distal to the forearc (cf. Heathcote and Mt Wellington Greenstone Belts). These characteristics indicate that basaltic magmatism in the Stawell Zone occurred in the backarc of a west-dipping subduction zone that initiated (i.e. generated) boninites farther east and southeast before undergoing rapid east-directed rollback.},

  abstract = {In this communication the 1-D steady-state heat conduction problem is solved in a stochastic framework incorporating uncertainties in the depth-dependent thermal conductivity. For this purpose, a new approach to the perturbation method, an expansion series method, which allows for the incorporation of a large variance in the controlling parameters, has been used. This method helps in avoiding assumptions on the probability distribution of the parameter and instead uses information pertaining to the mean and spatial correlation structure. This information is easily available in most geological situations and hence the thermal conductivity is assumed to have a Gaussian coloured noise correlation structure. With this information the stochastic heat conduction equation in equilibrium is solved and analytical expressions for the first two moments, that is, the mean and variance of the temperature field, are obtained. The expression for variance shows that it is highly dependent on the coefficient of variability of thermal conductivity, on the correlation length scale and on the depth. The methodology developed has been applied to quantify the steady-state geotherms, along with their associated error bounds, on a standard crustal model.},

We detected reflections of seismic waves from the core-mantle boundary of Mars using InSight seismic data and inverted these together with geodetic data to constrain the radius of the liquid metal core to 1830 {\textpm} 40 kilometers. The large core implies a martian mantle mineralogically similar to the terrestrial upper mantle and transition zone but differing from Earth by not having a bridgmanite-dominated lower mantle. We inferred a mean core density of 5.7 to 6.3 grams per cubic centimeter, which requires a substantial complement of light elements dissolved in the iron-nickel core. The seismic core shadow as seen from InSight's location covers half the surface of Mars, including the majority of potentially active regions---e.g., Tharsis---possibly limiting the number of detectable marsquakes.},

Plates were constructed through time by adding/removing oceanic material, symbolized by synthetic isochrons, to major continents and terranes. Driving forces like slab pull and slab buoyancy were used to constrain the evolution of paleo-oceanic domains. This approach offers good control of sea-floor spreading and plate kinematics. This new method represents a distinct departure from classical continental drift reconstructions, which are not constrained, due to the lack of plate boundaries. This model allows a more comprehensive analysis of the development of the Tethyan realm in space and time. In particular, the relationship between the Variscan and the Cimmerian cycles in the Mediterranean-Alpine realm is clearly illustrated by numerous maps. For the Alpine cycle, the relationship between the Alpides senso stricto and the Tethysides is also explicable in terms of plate tectonic development of the Alpine Tethys-Atlantic domain versus the NeoTethys domain. {\copyright} 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

This study performs tomographic inversion of surface wave travel times observed during the seismic profile carried out in Namibia in the framework of the SIMBA project. The thus obtained surface wave velocity model is used to complement the previously computed P- and S-wave models. Profile sections characterised by similar seismic velocities are identified as lithological classes and remapped in model space. Two methods are used to identify such classes: a manual identification of high probability zones in a probability density function, and an automatic neural network approach. The results of these two methods are consistent with each other. The availability of the surface wave velocity model as additional independent physical parameter increases the correlation between the remapped lithological classes and the geological map, leading to the conclusion that the identified classes correspond to real geological formations.},

Through feedbacks in the climate system, land ice variability modifies atmospheric temperature changes induced by orbital, topographical, and greenhouse gas variations. Quantification of these feedbacks on long timescales has hitherto scarcely been undertaken. In this study, we use a zonally averaged energy balance climate model bidirectionally coupled to a one-dimensional ice sheet model, capturing the ice--albedo and surface--height--temperature feedbacks. Potentially important transient changes in topographic boundary conditions by tectonics and erosion are not taken into account but are briefly discussed. The relative simplicity of the coupled model allows us to perform integrations over the past 38{\textbackslash}textlessspan class="thinspace"{\textbackslash}textgreater{\textbackslash}textless/span{\textbackslash}textgreaterMyr in a fully transient fashion using a benthic oxygen isotope record as forcing to inversely simulate CO{\textbackslash}textlesssub{\textbackslash}textgreater2{\textbackslash}textless/sub{\textbackslash}textgreater. Firstly, we find that the results of the simulations over the past 5{\textbackslash}textlessspan class="thinspace"{\textbackslash}textgreater{\textbackslash}textless/span{\textbackslash}textgreaterMyr are dependent on whether the model run is started at 5 or 38{\textbackslash}textlessspan class="thinspace"{\textbackslash}textgreater{\textbackslash}textless/span{\textbackslash}textgreaterMyr ago. This is because the relation between CO{\textbackslash}textlesssub{\textbackslash}textgreater2{\textbackslash}textless/sub{\textbackslash}textgreater and temperature is subject to hysteresis. When the climate cools from very high CO{\textbackslash}textlesssub{\textbackslash}textgreater2{\textbackslash}textless/sub{\textbackslash}textgreater levels, as in the longer transient 38{\textbackslash}textlessspan class="thinspace"{\textbackslash}textgreater{\textbackslash}textless/span{\textbackslash}textgreaterMyr run, temperatures in the lower CO{\textbackslash}textlesssub{\textbackslash}textgreater2{\textbackslash}textless/sub{\textbackslash}textgreater range of the past 5{\textbackslash}textlessspan class="thinspace"{\textbackslash}textgreater{\textbackslash}textless/span{\textbackslash}textgreaterMyr are higher than when the climate is initialised at low temperatures. Consequently, the modelled CO{\textbackslash}textlesssub{\textbackslash}textgreater2{\textbackslash}textless/sub{\textbackslash}textgreater concentrations depend on the initial state. Taking the realistic warm initialisation into account, we come to a best estimate of CO{\textbackslash}textlesssub{\textbackslash}textgreater2{\textbackslash}textless/sub{\textbackslash}textgreater, temperature, ice-volume-equivalent sea level, and benthic {\textbackslash}textlessi{\textbackslash}textgreater{$\delta\backslash$}textless/i{\textbackslash}textgreater{\textbackslash}textlesssup{\textbackslash}textgreater18{\textbackslash}textless/sup{\textbackslash}textgreaterO over the past 38{\textbackslash}textlessspan class="thinspace"{\textbackslash}textgreater{\textbackslash}textless/span{\textbackslash}textgreaterMyr. Secondly, we study the influence of ice sheets on the evolution of global temperature and polar amplification by comparing runs with ice sheet--climate interaction switched on and off. By passing only albedo or surface height changes to the climate model, we can distinguish the separate effects of the ice--albedo and surface--height--temperature feedbacks. We find that ice volume variability has a strong enhancing effect on atmospheric temperature changes, particularly in the regions where the ice sheets are located. As a result, polar amplification in the Northern Hemisphere decreases towards warmer climates as there is little land ice left to melt. Conversely, decay of the Antarctic ice sheet increases polar amplification in the Southern Hemisphere in the high-CO{\textbackslash}textlesssub{\textbackslash}textgreater2{\textbackslash}textless/sub{\textbackslash}textgreater regime. Our results also show that in cooler climates than the pre-industrial, the ice--albedo feedback predominates the surface--height--temperature feedback, while in warmer climates they are more equal in strength.{\textbackslash}textless/p{\textbackslash}textgreater}

  abstract = {Seismic tomography of the mantle provides a snapshot view of the present-day structure of subducted tectonic plates (slabs) in the mantle. However, a correct interpretation of how such features developed requires knowledge of both the history of plate motions, in particular the locations of subduction zones over time, as well as an understanding of how slabs deform and interact with the lower mantle. The understanding of seismic tomography requires a detailed knowledge of the motion of the trench with time, as well as the time-evolution of subduction zones and their associated slabs. We use 3-D numerical models to investigate two effects which can strongly influence the kinematics of subduction, in particular the migration of the trench: the width of the plate and the far-field boundary conditions of the subducting plate. These models study the full range of plate widths (300-6000 km) and are subjected to the full range of boundary conditions ("fixed," "free," and "pushed") representative of the tectonic settings found on Earth. Additionally, our results indicate that trailing edge boundary conditions dominate over the effect of plate width. Each boundary condition is identified to produce a particular trench migration behavior with an associated upper mantle slab morphology: (1) fixed edges result in retreating trenches and retrograde motion of the slab which ends up lying flat atop the lower mantle, (2) free-trailing edges tend to exhibit quasi-stationary trenches with slabs developing into folded piles atop the lower mantle, and (3) pushed trailing edges generally result in advancing trenches that overrun previously subducted material to form forward-draping slabs lying prone atop the lower mantle. This range of behavior can be observed in seismic tomography and an example of each is provided. Within each suite of models with similar boundary conditions, plate width has a subsidiary role in the observed slab morphology but three distinct regimes of plate width can be distinguished in regards to trench migration. Thus plate width is an important effect on trench migration and does result in notable differences in slab morphologies between narrow and wide plate widths.},

  abstract = {Previous models of subduction (both analogue and numerical) have observed a number of distinct styles of subduction, each with particular subduction motions (partitioned between slab rollback and forward plate advance) and associated slab morphologies. We use 3-D numerical models to investigate subduction dynamics by varying the strength of slabs as well as the buoyancy, and propose a new classification based on these parameters. The slab strength is specified both through the ratio of viscosities between the subducting plate and upper mantle ({$\eta$}plate/{$\eta$}um) as well as the plate thickness, hplate. Only a very restrictive range of plates ("strong" plates with smaller buoyancy) tend to favor modes of subduction which are exclusively advancing. Plates which have greater negative buoyancy will eventually transition into a retreating style. We find that the flexural strength and the buoyancy determine the subduction style (as distinguished by a characteristic slab morphology), and control several subduction characteristics including the partitioning between slab rollback and plate advance, the trench curvature, and the slab's radius of curvature. Plates that are 80-100 km thick with {$\eta$}plate/{$\eta$}um {$\sim$} 100-300 are classified here as "weak" and are the only plates to exhibit slab geometry with several recumbent folds atop the more viscous lower mantle. This regime of weak plates with their associated slab morphologies (predominant folding) is argued to be most similar to slabs on Earth based on the presence of folded slab piles in Earth's upper mantle (as interpreted from seismic tomography). {\copyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {The outermost layer of the solid Earth consists of relatively rigid plates whose horizontal motions are well described by the rules of plate tectonics. Yet, the thickness of these plates is poorly constrained, with different methods giving widely discrepant results. Here a recently developed procedure to derive lithospheric thickness from seismic tomography with a simple thermal model is discussed. Thickness is calibrated such that the average as a function of seafloor age matches the theoretical curve for half-space cooling. Using several recent tomography models, predicted thickness agrees quite well with what is expected from half-space cooling in many oceanic areas younger than ???. 110. Myr. Thickness increases less strongly with age for older oceanic lithosphere, and is quite variable on continents, with thick lithosphere up to ???. 250. km inferred for many cratons. Results are highly correlated for recent shear-wave tomography models. Also, comparison to previous approaches based on tomography shows that results remain mostly similar in pattern, although somewhat more variable in the mean value and amount of variation. Global correlations with and between lithosphere thicknesses inferred from receiver functions or heat flow are much lower. However, results inferred from tomography and elastic thickness are correlated highly, giving additional confidence in these patterns of thickness variations, and implying that tomographically inferred thickness may correlate with depth-integrated strength. Thermal scaling from seismic velocities to temperatures yields radial profiles that agree with half-space cooling over large parts of their depth range, in particular for averaged profiles for given lithosphere thickness ranges. However, strong deviations from half-space cooling profiles are found in thick continental lithosphere above depth ???. 150. km, most likely due to compositional differences.},

  abstract = {Subduction erosion occurs at all convergent plate boundaries, even if they are also accretionary margins. Frontal subduction erosion results from a combination of erosion and structural collapse of the forearc wedge into the trench, and basal subduction erosion by abrasion and hydrofracturing above the subduction channel. High rates of subduction erosion are associated with relatively high convergence rates ({\textbackslash}textgreater60mm/yr) and low rates of sediment supply to the trench ({\textbackslash}textless40km2/yr), implying a narrow and topographically rough subduction channel which is neither smoothed out nor lubricated by fine-grained water-rich turbidites such as are transported into the mantle below accreting plate boundaries. Rates of subduction erosion, which range up to {\textbackslash}textgreater440km3/km/my, vary temporally as a function of these same factors, as well as the subduction of buoyant features such as seamount chains, submarine volcanic plateaus, island arcs and oceanic spreading ridge, due to weakening of the forearc wedge. Revised estimates of long-term rates of subduction erosion appropriate for selected margins, including SW Japan ({$\geq$}30km3/km/my since 400Ma), SW USA ({$\geq$}30km3/km/my since 150Ma), Peru and northern Chile (50-70km3/km/my since {\textbackslash}textgreater150Ma), and central (115km3/km/my since 30Ma) and southernmost Chile (30-35km3/km/my since 15Ma), are higher than in previous compilations. Globally, subduction erosion is responsible for {\textbackslash}textgreater1.7Armstrong Units (1AU=1km3/yr) of crustal loss, 33\% of the {$\sim$}5.25AU of yearly total crustal loss, and more than any one other of sediment subduction (1.65AU), continental lower crustal delamination ({$\geq$}1.1AU), crustal subduction during continental collision (0.4AU), and/or subduction of rock-weathering generated chemical solute that is dissolved in oceanic crust (0.4AU). The paucity of pre-Neoproterozoic blueschists suggests that global rates of subduction erosion were probably greater in the remote past, perhaps due to higher plate convergence rates. Subducted sediments and crust removed from the over-riding forearc wedge by subduction erosion may remain in the crust by being underplated below the wedge, or these crustal debris may be carried deeper into the source region of arc magmatism and incorporated into arc magmas by either dehydration of the subducted slab and the transport of their soluble components into the overlying mantle wedge source of arc basalts, and/or bulk melting of the subducted crust to produce adakites. In selected locations such as in Chile, Costa Rica, Japan and SW USA, strong cases can be made for the temporal and spatial correlations of distinctive crustal isotopic characteristics of arc magmas and episodes or areas of enhanced subduction erosion. Nevertheless, overall most subducted crust and sediment, {\textbackslash}textgreater90\% ({\textbackslash}textgreater3.0AU), is transported deeper into the mantle and neither underplated below the forearc wedge nor incorporated in arc magmas. The total current rate of return of continental crust into the deeper mantle, the most important process for which is subduction erosion, is equal to or greater than the estimates of the rate at which the crust is being replaced by arc and plume magmatic activity, indicating that currently the continental crust is probably slowly shrinking. However, rates of crustal growth may have been episodically more rapid in the past, most likely at times of supercontinent breakup, and conversely, rates of crustal destruction may have also been higher during times of supercontinent amalgamation. Thus the supercontinent cycle controls the relative rates of growth and/or destruction of the continental crust. Subduction erosion plays an important role in producing and maintaining this cycle by transporting radioactive elements from the crust into the mantle, perhaps as deep as the 670km upper-to-lower mantle transition, or even deeper down to the core-mantle boundary, where heating of this subducted crustal material initiates plumes and superplumes. {\copyright} 2011 International Association for Gondwana Research.},

Computation of the isotropic elastic wave velocities of a pyrolytic bulk composition in thermodynamic equilibrium shows a distinct low-velocity zone with a minimum velocity V-S = 4.47 km s(-1) along the 100 Ma geotherm. In the vicinity of the low-velocity zone the velocity of this null hypothesis is approximated along oceanic geotherms by V-S = 4.77 + 0.0380(P, z/29.80) - 0.000378(T - 300), with pressure P in GPa, depth z in km, temperature T in K, and velocity V-S in km s(-1). The null hypothesis predicts a minimum V-S 0.1-0.2 km s(-1) higher than that in seismological models of 100 Ma Pacific. We find that dispersion, estimated solely on the basis of seismological attenuation models, can account for this residual velocity deficit. Except in the immediate vicinity of the ridge (t {\textbackslash}textless 5 Ma), a solid-state low-velocity zone provides a satisfactory quantitative explanation of seismic observations. We do not find a satisfactory explanation for the magnitude of the Gutenberg discontinuity or for the high shear wave velocity gradient zone.},

  abstract = {We present a theory for the computation of phase equilibria and physical properties of multicomponent assemblages relevant to the mantle of the Earth. The theory differs from previous treatments in being thermodynamically self-consistent: the theory is based on the concept of fundamental thermodynamic relations appropriately generalized to anisotropic strain and in encompassing elasticity in addition to the usual isotropic thermodynamic properties. In this first paper, we present the development of the theory, discuss its scope, and focus on its application to physical properties of mantle phases at elevated pressure and temperature including the equation of state, thermochernical properties and the elastic wave velocities. We find that the Eulerian finite strain formulation captures the variation of the elastic moduli with compression. The variation of the vibrational frequencies with compression is also cast as a Taylor series expansion in the Eulerian finite strain, the appropriate volume derivative of which leads to an expression for the Gruneisen parameter that agrees well with results from first principles theory. For isotropic materials, the theory contains nine material-specific parameters: the values at ambient conditions of the Helmholtz free energy, volume, bulk and shear moduli, their pressure derivatives, an effective Debye temperature, its first and second logarithmic volume derivatives (gamma(o), q(0)), and the shear strain derivative of gamma. We present and discuss in some detail the results of a global inversion of a wide variety of experimental data and first principles theoretical results, supplemented by systematic relations, for the values of these parametersfor 31 mantle species. Among our findings is that the value of q is likely to be significantly greater than unity for most mantle species. We apply the theory to the computation of the shear wave velocity, and temperature and compositional (Fe content) derivatives at relevant mantle pressure temperature conditions. Among the patterns that emerge is that garnet is anomalous in being remarkably insensitive to iron content or temperature as compared with other mantle phases.},

Comparisons between our method and experimental phase equilibria data encompass the pressure-temperature regime of Earth's mantle.

  abstract = {We present analogue models of free subduction in which we investigate the three-dimensional (3-D) subduction-induced mantle flow focusing around the slab edges. We use a stereoscopic Particle Image Velocimetry (sPIV) technique to map the 3-D mantle flow on 4 vertical cross-sections for one experiment and on 3 horizontal depth-sections for another experiment. On each section the in-plane components are mapped as well as the out-of-plane component for several experimental times. The results indicate that four types of maximum upwelling are produced by the subduction-induced mantle flow. The first two are associated with the poloidal circulation occurring in the mantle wedge and in the sub-slab domain. A third type is produced by horizontal motion and deformation of the frontal part of the slab lying on the 660 km discontinuity. The fourth type results from quasi-toroidal return flow around the lateral slab edges, which produces a maximum upwelling located slightly laterally away from the sub-slab domain and can have another maximum upwelling located laterally away from the mantle wedge. These upwellings occur during the whole subduction process. In contrast, the poloidal circulation in the mantle wedge produces a zone of upwelling that is vigorous during the free falling phase of the slab sinking but that decreases in intensity when reaching the steady-state phase. The position of the maximum upward component and horizontal components of the mantle flow velocity field has been tracked through time. Their time-evolving magnitude is well correlated to the trench retreat rate. The maximum upwelling velocity located laterally away from the subducting plate is {$\sim$}18-24\% of the trench retreat rate during the steady-state subduction phase. It is observed in the mid upper mantle but upwellings are produced throughout the whole upper mantle thickness, potentially promoting decompression melting. It could thereby provide a source for intraplate volcanism, such as Mount Etna in the Mediterranean, the Chiveluch group of volcanoes in Kamchatka and the Samoan hotspot near Tonga. {\copyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {The dynamics of the theta method for arbitrary systems of nonlinear ordinary differential equations are analysed. Two scalar examples are presented to demonstrate the importance of spurious solutions in determining the dynamics of discretisations. A general system of differential equations is then considered. It is shown that the choice 0 does not generate spurious solutions 1/2 of period 2 in the timestep n. Using bifurcation theory, it is shown that for 0 the theta method does generate spurious solutions of period 2. The existence and form of spurious solutions are examined in the limit At 0. The existence of spurious steady solutions in a predictor-corrector method is proved to be equivalent to the existence of spurious period 2 solutions in the Euler method. The theory is applied to several examples from nonlinear parabolic equations. Numerical continuation is used to trace out the spurious solutions as At is varied. Timestepping experiments are presented to demonstrate the effect of the spurious solutions on the dynamics and some complementary the1/2 oretical results are proved. In particular, the linear stability restriction At/Ax2 {$<\_$} for the Euler method applied to the heat equation is generalised to cope with a nonlinear problem. This naturally introduces a restriction on At in terms of the initial data; this restriction is necessary to avoid the effect of spurious periodic solutions.},

This approach allows for a full characterization of all possible solutions, and their relative probabilities, whilst simultaneously forcing significant modelling issues to be addressed in a clear and precise fashion. Although expensive to implement, this approach is starting to lie within the range of the available computational resources in many application areas. It also allows for the quantification of uncertainty and risk, something which is increasingly demanded by these applications.

Its usefulness is beyond controversy. However, the use of the word ``age'' for groundwater connected with these techniques is misleading due to its inherent connection to the general understanding of human age. ``Age'' as in the understanding of human age cannot be determined for groundwater, although it is a useful zero-order concept abundantly used in this context. This paper describes three basic definitions of ``age'' for groundwater ((1) idealized age as in particle tracking and piston flow, (2) mean residence time involving an age distribution and (3) apparent age) and discusses their context in view of recent developments in numerical groundwater modelling. It further gives arguments why the term ``age'' is unnecessary in modern hydrology and groundwater management and how not using it can enhance efficiency in system understanding: not using age needs less modelling effort and allows comparing models directly with measured values instead of comparing models with models. {\'O} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Migratory southward plume-related volcanism, the East Australian Plume System, was prominent after 35 Ma, but new studies reveal unusual features. 'Swell and pinch' episodes produced large central volcanoes in initial west-directed 'swells' followed by smaller volume fields in easterly 'pinches' in late activity. These episodes ('boomerangs') each lasted over 10-20 million years, as sidestepping bursts along four main plume lines. The Tasmantid subma- rine volcanic line shows a westerly 'swell' in concert with that in a major Queensland line. Reconstruction of Australian palaeoplate motions from the present dormant plume array match times of'swell and pinch' activity, but not its bending. Each episode includes a less curved, precur- sory migratory line, erupted some 3 million years before the main migratory line. Plume lines pro- jected back beyond 40 Ma give increasingly divergent plate paths depending on use of a Pacific or Indian hot-spot frame. Averaged plate paths coincide with Coral Sea - Louisiade spreading at 60 Ma, suggesting its potential role in originating the plume array. Precursor and main 'boomerang' activity may arise from separate initial plume pulses: lesser rift-related pulse followed by a stronger spreading-related pulse. An alternative possibility is a dual line plume progression caused by trans- fer of activity through loading and flexure. The west-bending 'swells' appear to reflect plume deflec- tion during plume surges. Isotopic Sr, Nd and Pb relationships between East Australian Plume System and other Australian basalts suggest the plume array straddles the Indian and Pacific mantle domain boundary. Replacement of wedges of Indian-type mantle by Pacific-type mantle during northerly Australian Plate translation may focus dynamic flow vectors that contribute to west-bend- ing 'boomerang' migratory volcanism},

  abstract = {Rare ruby crystals appear among prevailing sapphire crystals mined from placers within basaltic areas in the New England gem-field, New South Wales, Australia. New England ruby (NER) has distinctive trace element features compared to those from ruby elsewhere in Australia and indeed most ruby from across the world. The NER suite includes ruby (up to 3370 ppm Cr), pink sapphire (up to 1520 ppm Cr), white sapphire (up to 910 ppm) and violet, mauve, purple, or bluish sapphire (up to 1410 ppm Cr). Some crystals show outward growth banding in this respective colour sequence. All four colour zones are notably high in Ga (up to 310 ppm) and Si (up to 1820 ppm). High Ga and Ga/Mg values are unusual in ruby and its trace element plots (laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma---mass spectrometry) and suggests that magmatic--metasomatic inputs were involved in the NER suite genesis. In situ oxygen isotope analyses (secondary ion mass spectrometry) across the NER suite colour range showed little variation (n = 22; {$\delta$}18O = 4.4 {\textpm} 0.4, 2{$\sigma$} error), and are values typical for corundum associated with ultramafic/mafic rocks. The isolated NER xenocryst suite, corroded by basalt transport and with few internal inclusions, presents a challenge in deciphering its exact origin. Detailed consideration of its high Ga chemistry in relation to the known geology of the surrounding region was used to narrow down potential sources. These include Late Palaeozoic--Triassic fractionated I-type granitoid magmas or Mesozoic--Cenozoic felsic fractionates from basaltic magmas that interacted with early Palaeozoic Cr-bearing ophiolite bodies in the New England Orogen. Other potential sources may lie deeper within lower crust--mantle metamorphic assemblages, but need to match the anomalous high-Ga geochemistry of the New England ruby suite.},

  abstract = {Recent experimental studies have shown that anelasticity of polycrystalline materials is subject to the Maxwell frequency (fM) scaling: Q-1(f/fM). However, the applicability of this scaling to the seismic waves has not been guaranteed because experimental frequencies normalized to fM of the laboratory samples are usually much lower than the seismic frequencies normalized to fM in the upper mantle (106 {$\leq$} f/fM {$\leq$} 109). In this study, by using polycrystalline organic borneol as an analogue to mantle rock, we measured anelasticity up to f/fM {$\simeq$} 108 and found that theMaxwell frequency scaling is not fully applicable at f/fM {\textbackslash}textgreater 104. A closer examination showed that each of the relaxation spectra obtained under various temperature, grain size, and chemical composition can be represented by the superposition of a background dissipation subject to theMaxwell frequency scaling and a peak dissipation centered at f/fM {$\simeq$} 103. Significant increases of the peak amplitude and width with increasing temperature, grain size, and impurity content result in failure of theMaxwell frequency scaling at f/fM{\textbackslash}textgreater104, where the peak dissipation dominates over the background dissipation. The peak is significantly broadened near the solidus temperature (T/Tmelt = 0.93), producing an absorption band toward the normalized seismic frequencies. The absorption band suggested by the present data is characterized by variable amplitude and width, indicating a nonlinear reduction of seismic velocity near the solidus.},

The Changbaishan volcanic complex, located on the border between China and North Korea, lies approximately 1,300 km away from the Japan Trench subduction zone and is unlikely to result from a mantle plume rising from a thermal boundary layer at the base of the mantle. Here we use seismic images and three-dimensional waveform modelling results obtained from the NECESSArray experiment to identify a slow, continuous seismic anomaly in the mantle beneath Changbaishan. The anomaly extends from just below 660 km depth to the surface beneath Changbaishan and occurs within a gap in the stagnant subducted Pacific Plate. We propose that the anomaly represents hot and buoyant sub-lithospheric mantle that has been entrained beneath the sinking lithosphere of the Pacific Plate and is now escaping through a gap in the subducting slab. We suggest that this subduction-induced upwelling process produces decompression melting that feeds the Changbaishan volcanoes. Subduction-induced upwelling may also explain back-arc volcanism observed at other subduction zones. {\copyright} 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.}

We show that the average thickness of active continental crust varied on billion-year time scales, with the thickest crust formed in the Archean and Phanerozoic. By contrast, the Proterozoic witnessed continuously decreasing crustal thickness, leaving the continents devoid of high mountains until the end of the eon. We link this gradually diminished orogenesis to the long-lived Nuna-Rodinia supercontinent, which altered the mantle thermal structure and weakened the continental lithosphere. This prolonged orogenic quiescence may have resulted in a persistent famine in the oceans and stalled life's evolution in Earth's middle age.},

Several large left-lateral strike-slip faults may have been activated successively, essentially one at a time. The experiments suggest that the penetration of India into Asia has rotated (=25{$^\circ$}) and extruded (=800 km) Indochina to the southeast along the then left-lateral Red River fault in the first 20 to 30 m.y. of the collision. This process can account for the opening of the South China Sea before late Miocene time. Extrusion tectonics then migrated north, activating the Altyn Tagh fault as a second major left-lateral fault and moving southern China hundreds of kilometres to the east. As this occurred, Indochina kept rotating clockwise (as much as 40{$^\circ$}), but the sense of motion reversed on the Red River and other strike-slip faults in the south. Opening of the Mergui basin and Andaman Sea (up to the present) also appears to be a simple kinematic consequence of the extrusion. Recent rifts in northeastern China and Yunnan may be considered incipient analogs of the South China and Andaman Seas. Other Tertiary tectonic features such as the sedimentary basins of the Gulf of Thailand may be explained as collisional effects, if one uses our experiments as a guide. The experiments also suggest that a major left-lateral strike-slip fault and rift system will propagate across the Tien Shan, Mongolia, and Baikal to the Sea of Okhotsk.},

  abstract = {Tectonic studies show that intraplate Europe is more active than might be expected from its tectonic setting. We employ integrative analysis of various datasets, which provides new understanding of deformation processes in response to different types of loading. A 3D strength model of the lithosphere, which is based on existing structural, compositional and thermal models of the lithosphere, forms the basis for this study. Boundaries of the crustal layers are determined from existing seismic data. Constraints on the thermal structure of the lithosphere are obtained from heat flow studies and upper mantle seismic tomography. The calculated strength distribution is used to quantify spatial variations in effective elastic plate thickness (EET) of the European lithosphere. A comparison with seismic and geodetic strain rates provides new insights into the localization of intraplate deformation. Another important indication of lithospheric strength is provided by the residual mantle gravity anomalies obtained after removing the crustal contribution from the observed gravity field. We have found significant spatial variations in rigidity within the Central and Western European lithosphere, in contrast with a more uniform strong lithosphere of the East European Platform. These variations are consistent with differences in the density structure of the mantle lithosphere reflected in mantle gravity anomalies. Western Europe is mostly characterized by negative mantle gravity anomalies and low EET values (generally {$\leq$} 20 km), whereas the opposite is true for Eastern Europe. Large differences exist also for specific tectonic units: e.g. a pronounced contrast in lithosphere properties is found between the strong Adriatic plate and the weak Pannonian Basin area, as well as between the Baltic Shield and the North Sea rift system. We demonstrate that the European Cenozoic Rift System (ECRIS), which is characterized by low EET values and negative mantle gravity anomalies, localizes neotectonic deformation manifested by relatively high geodetic and seismic strain rates. {\copyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The rate at which algorithms for computing the best fit to data converge depends on the size of the condition number and the distribution of eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix, which contains the second derivatives of this quadratic function. The inverse of the Hessian can be identified as the covariance matrix that establishes the accuracy to which the model state is determined by the data; the reciprocals of the Hessian's eigenvalues represent the variances of linear combinations of variables determined by its eigenvectors. The aspect of the model state that are most difficult to compute are those about which the data provide the least information. A unified formalism is presented in which the model may be treated as providing either strong or weak constraints, and methods for computing and inverting the Hessian matrix are discussed. Examples are given of the uncertainties resulting from fitting an oceanographic model to several different sets of hypothetical data.},

There is little evidence for modern-style plate tectonics, and based on the simplicity and spatial extent of the felsic crust, models favouring vertical tectonic processes such as crustal delamination or plume activity appear better suited to the results. Data from the Hearne domain, which exhibits widespread {$\sim$}. 2.7. Ga granite-and-greenstone geology, show a more complex crust with higher Vp/Vs ratios, consistent with a greater mafic component. The Trans-Hudson Orogen (THO), proposed to be a Himalayan-scale mountain belt during the Paleoproterozoic, is thought to have formed during the {$\sim$}. 1.8. Ga collision of the Superior and Churchill plates. Results from the Quebec-Baffin Island segment of the THO appear to map out the first-order shape of the underthrusting Superior plate, with elevated Vp/Vs ratios likely representing the rifted margin of the Superior craton. Consistently thicker crust is observed beneath central and southern Baffin Island ({$\sim$}43. km), coincident with widespread high-grade metamorphic surface geology. These features can be explained by crustal thickening due to stacking of accreted terranes during continent-continent collision, analogous to the present-day Tibetan Plateau, followed by erosion. When reviewed in light of age and compositional constraints from the geological record, our seismic observations point towards secular crustal evolution from non-plate tectonic during the Paleo- to Mesoarchean evolving towards fully-developed modern-style plate tectonics during the Paleoproterozoic. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Interactions between crustal and mantle reservoirs dominate the surface inventory of volatile elements over geological time, moderating atmospheric composition and maintaining a life-supporting planet. While volcanoes expel volatile components into surface reservoirs, subduction of oceanic crust is responsible for replenishment of mantle reservoirs. Many natural, {\^a} {\texteuro}superdeep{\^a} {\texteuro}‚Ñ¢ diamonds originating in the deep upper mantle and transition zone host mineral inclusions, indicating an affinity to subducted oceanic crust. Here we show that the majority of slab geotherms will intersect a deep depression along the melting curve of carbonated oceanic crust at depths of approximately 300 to 700 kilometres, creating a barrier to direct carbonate recycling into the deep mantle. Low-degree partial melts are alkaline carbonatites that are highly reactive with reduced ambient mantle, producing diamond. Many inclusions in superdeep diamonds are best explained by carbonate melt-peridotite reaction. A deep carbon barrier may dominate the recycling of carbon in the mantle and contribute to chemical and isotopic heterogeneity of the mantle reservoir.}

  abstract = {Hot spot volcanism may originate from the deep mantle in regions exhibiting the Earth's most pronounced lateral S-wave velocity gradients. These strong gradient regions display an improved geographic correlation over S-wave velocities to surface hot spot locations. For the lowest velocities or strongest gradients occupying 10\% of the surface area of the core-mantle boundary (CMB), hot spots are nearly twice as likely to overlie the anomalous gradients. If plumes arise in an isochemical lower mantle, plume initiation should occur in the hottest (thus lowest velocity) regions, or in the regions of strongest temperature gradients. However, if plume initiation occurs in the lowest velocity regions of the CMB lateral deflection of plumes or plume roots are required. The average lateral deflections of hot spot root locations from the vertical of the presumed current hot spot location ranges from ???300 to 900 km at the CMB for the 10-30\% of the CMB covered by the most anomalous low S-wave velocities. The deep mantle may, however, contain strong temperature gradients or be compositionally heterogeneous, with plume initiation in regions of strong lateral S-wave velocity gradients as well as low S-wave velocity regions. If mantle plumes arise from strong gradient regions, only half of the lateral deflection from plume root to hot spot surface location is required for the 10-30\% of the CMB covered by the most anomalous strong lateral S-wave velocities. We find that strong gradient regions typically surround the large lower velocity regions in the base of the mantle, which may indicate a possible chemical, in addition to thermal, component to these regions. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

First, we calculate how the admittance between measured free-air gravity and topography varies as a function of wavelength. A simple model, which consists of a crust with two layers of different densities overlying a higher density mantle, was then used to calculate admittance functions. The misfit between observed and calculated admittance was minimized by varying elastic thickness and the proportion of the total load due to internal loading. At short wavelengths \{lambda\} {\textbackslash}textless 200 km), the fit between observed and calculated admittance is consistent with an elastic thickness of 5 \{+/-\} 2 km and a small proportion of internal loading (c. 0.2). The general behaviour of the observed admittance suggests that topography is primarily supported by elastic stresses in the crust. A small departure between observed and calculated admittance at the longest wavelengths (400{\textbackslash}textless \{lambda\} {\textbackslash}textless1000 km) is consistent with modest dynamic support which is probably convective in origin.},

The manufacturing process, which enabled silica cementation of quartz sand grains, was found to produce realistic sandstones of average porosity 29.7 {\textpm} 0.5\% and average permeability 29.4 {\textpm} 11.3 mD. One sample was made with a regular distribution of aligned, penny-shaped voids to simulate meso-scale fractures in reservoir rocks, while the other was left blank. Ultrasonic shear waves were measured with a propagation direction of 90{$^\circ$} to the coincident bedding plane and fracture normal. In the water saturated blank sample, shear-wave splitting, the percentage velocity difference between the fast and slow shear waves, of {\textbackslash}textless0.5\% was measured due to the bedding planes (or layering) introduced during sample preparation. In the fractured sample, shear-wave splitting (corrected for layering anisotropy) of 2.72 {\textpm} 0.58\% for water, 2.80 {\textpm} 0.58\% for air and 3.21 {\textpm} 0.58\% for glycerin saturation at a net pressure of 40 MPa was measured. Analysis of X-ray CT scan images was used to determine a fracture density of 0.0298 {\textpm} 0.077 in the fractured sample. This supports theoretical predictions that shear-wave splitting (SWS) can be used as a good estimate for fracture density in porous rocks (i.e., SWS = 100{$\epsilon$}f, where {$\epsilon$}f is fracture density) regardless of pore fluid type, for wave propagation at 90{$^\circ$} to the fracture normal.},

Major characteristics of Zealandia's Cenozoic volcanism include longevity, irregular distribution and lack of age progressions in the direction of plate motion, or indeed any systematic temporal or spatial geochemical variations. We believe that these characteristics can be best explained in the context of lithospheric detachment, which causes upwelling and melting of the upper asthenospheric mantle and portions of the removed lithosphere. We propose that a large-scale seismic low-velocity anomaly, that stretches from beneath West Antarctica to Zealandia at a depth of {\textbackslash}textgreater 600 km may represent a geochemical reservoir that has been in existence since the Cretaceous, and has been supplying the upper mantle beneath Zealandia with HIMU-type plume material throughout the Cenozoic. In addition, the sources of the Cenozoic intraplate volcanism may be at least partially derived through melting of locally detached Zealandia lower lithosphere. {\copyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

One of the most significant issues is its thermal history and the current thermal state. Several hypotheses involving a thermally-convecting inner core have been proposed: a simple, high-viscosity, translational mode, or a classical, lower-viscosity, plume-style convection. Here, we use state-of-the-art seismic imaging to probe the outermost shell of the inner core for its isotropic compressional speed and compare it with recently developed attenuation maps. The pattern emerging in the resulting tomograms is interpreted with recent data on the viscosity of iron as the inner core surface manifestation of a thermally-driven flow, with a positive correlation among compressional speed and attenuation and temperature. Although the outer-core convection controls the heat flux across the inner core boundary, the internally driven inner-core convection is a plausible model that explains a range of observations for the inner core, including distinct anisotropy in the innermost inner core.},

In the neighbouring Lachlan River valley, the stratigraphy of Neogene sediments has been incorporated into a model proposing denudation and episodic passive (denudational isostatic) uplift of the highlands throughout the Neogene. In this study, we aimed to test the regional extent of this model and the influence of sediment supply on the stratigraphic record and its interpretation. The sediments of the Macquarie River valley show three major changes in the depositional regime. First, erosion of the valley basement in the Late Miocene was followed by (and possibly synchronous with) deposition of a basal clay and sand unit in the Late Miocene. Second, the valley was filled with a wedge of sediment containing abundant gravel and sand in the Pliocene; and third, the older gravelly unit was eroded and reworked in the Quaternary, and a sandy clay unit, which forms the modern floodplain, was deposited. Deformation of the Middle Miocene basalt-filled valley provides good evidence for substantial uplift of the highlands in the Middle-Late Miocene, synchronous with or shortly after widespread volcanism, but continuing no later than the Late Miocene. The Pleistocene incision is best accounted for by climate change to drier conditions, triggering a sediment-starved response by the Macquarie River, rather than further uplift. While valley incision and subsequent infilling can be viewed as a response to tectonism, the internal sedimentology and stratigraphy of the sediments appears to respond to fluctuations in sediment supply brought about by extrinsic climate change and intrinsic catchment lithology. The first-order tectonic events are not synchronous with uplift in the Lachlan valley and are restricted to relatively local spatial scales. However, the secondary climatic forcing has a broader regional expression.},

The results of the study augment the dense offshore and sparse onshore models of the velocity structure beneath the area. In total almost 1500 receiver functions have been analysed, which have been calculated using teleseismic data from 34 broadband and short-period, three-component seismic recording instruments. The crustal structure has primarily been investigated using 1-D grid search and forward modelling techniques, returning crustal thicknesses, bulk crustal V-p/V-s ratio and velocity-depth models. H - kappa stacking reveals crustal thicknesses between 25 and 36 km and V-p/V-s ratios between 1.6 and 1.9. The crustal thicknesses correlate with the results of previous seismic reflection and refraction profiles to within +/- 2 km. The significant exceptions are the stations close to the Iapetus Suture where the receiver function crustal thicknesses are up to 5 km less than the seismic refraction Moho. This mismatch could be linked to the presence of underplated magmatic material at the base of the crust. 1-D forward modelling has revealed subcrustal structures in northern Scotland. These correlate with results from other UK receiver function studies, and correspond with the Flannan and W-reflectors. The structures are truncated or pinch out before they reach the Midland Valley of Scotland. The isolated subcrustal structure at station GIM on the Isle of Man may be related to the closure of the Iapetus Ocean.},

One property of the potential field equations is that they are given by convolution products, providing a very simple analytic expression in the Fourier domain. Under this assumption, the domain of the density or magnetization parameters is connected by a biunivoc relationship with the data space, and potential field anomalies can be seen as filtered versions of the corresponding density or magnetization distributions. A very fine spatial discretization can be obtained by using a large number of points within a unique 3-D grid, where both the source distributions and field data are defined. The main advantage of this formulation is that it dramatically reduces execution times, providing a very fast forward model tool useful for modeling anomalies at different altitudes. We use this method to evaluate an average magnetization of 8 A/m for the Palinuro Seamount in the Tyrrhenian Sea (southern Italy), thus performing a joint interpretation of morphological and newly acquired magnetic data.},

  abstract = {Riverbank retreat along a bend of the Cecina River, Tuscany (central Italy) was monitored across a near annual cycle (autumn 2003 to summer 2004) with the aim of better understanding the factors influencing bank changes and processes at a seasonal scale. Seven flow events occurred during the period of investigation, with the largest having an estimated return period of about 1{$\cdot$}5 years. Bank simulations were performed by linking hydrodynamic, fluvial erosion, groundwater flow and bank stability models, for the seven flow events, which are representative of the typical range of hydrographs that normally occur during an annual cycle. The simulations allowed identification of (i) the time of onset and cessation of mass failure and fluvial erosion episodes, (ii) the contributions to total bank retreat made by specific fluvial erosion and mass-wasting processes, and (iii) the causes of retreat. The results show that the occurrence of bank erosion processes (fluvial erosion, slide failure, cantilever failure) and their relative dominance differ significantly for each event, depending on seasonal hydrological conditions and initial bank geometry. Due to the specific planimetric configuration of the study bend, which steers the core of high velocity fluid away from the bank at higher flow discharges, fluvial erosion tends to occur during particular phases of the hydrograph. As a result fluvial erosion is ineffective at higher peak discharges, and depends more on the duration of more moderate discharges. Slide failures appear to be closely related to the magnitude of peak river stages, typically occurring in close proximity to the peak phase (preferentially during the falling limb, but in some cases even before the peak), while cantilever failures more typically occur in the late phase of the flow hydrograph, when they may be induced by the cumulative effects of any fluvial erosion.},

Correlative sequences in Antarctica provide evidence that convergent deformation (Ross Orogeny) commenced between 580 and 540 Ma, leading to the interpretation that the locus of deformation migrated or jumped northward along the paleo{\^a}{\texteuro}{\dbend}Pacific margin of Gondwana. However, the absence of upper Neoproterozoic sequences in the southern Adelaide Rift Complex requires either significant pre{\^a}{\texteuro}{\dbend}Kanmantoo erosion (for which there is no evidence) or a depositional hiatus due to uplift. New Rb{\^a}{\texteuro}{\dbend}Sr data from solution cleavage in Brachina Formation sedimentary rocks at Hallett Cove, South Australia, date deformation at 554\${\textbackslash}backslash\$pm 10 Ma, while 40Ar/39Ar data on white mica in the center of the cleavage yield a relatively flat plateau{\^a}{\texteuro}{\dbend}like segment with an age of 533\${\textbackslash}backslash\$pm 15 Ma. Additional evidence for a pre{\^a}{\texteuro}{\dbend}514{\^a}{\texteuro}{\dbend}Ma onset of deformation is provided by a 525\${\textbackslash}backslash\$pm 7 {\^a}{\texteuro}{\dbend}Ma 40Ar/39Ar age for biotite that developed in a mylonite within a Mesoproterozoic granitic gneiss in the Myponga basement inlier to the south of Hallett Cove. Thus, the data imply that convergence commenced more or less synchronously with contraction during the Ross Orogeny in Antarctica. Deposition of the Cambrian Kanmantoo Group therefore occurred in a synorogenic setting analogous to deposition of the upper Byrd Group in Antarctica.}

The software is implemented in the C programming language and uses tesseroids (spherical prisms) for the discretization of the subsurface mass distribution. The gravitational fields of tesseroids are calculated numerically using the Gauss-Legendre quadrature (GLQ). We have improved upon an adaptive discretization algorithm to guar-antee the accuracy of the GLQ integration. Our implementation of adaptive discretization uses a " stack-based " algorithm instead of recursion to achieve more control over execution errors and corner cases. The algorithm is controlled by a scalar value called the distance-size ratio (D) that determines the accuracy of the in-tegration as well as the computation time. We have determined optimal values of D for the gravitational potential, gravitational acceleration, and gravity gradient tensor by comparing the com-puted tesseroids effects with those of a homogenous spherical shell. The values required for a maximum relative error of 0.1\% of the shell effects are D {$\frac{1}{4}$} 1 for the gravitational potential, D {$\frac{1}{4}$} 1.5 for the gravitational acceleration, and D {$\frac{1}{4}$} 8 for the gravity gradients. Contrary to previous assumptions, our results show that the potential and its first and second derivatives require different values of D to achieve the same accuracy. These values were incorporated as defaults in the software.}

The interaction between groundwater and surface water along the Tambo and Nicholson rivers, southeast Australia, was investigated using 222Rn, Cl, differential flow gauging, head gradients, electrical conductivity (EC) and temperature profiles. Head gradients, temperature profiles, Cl concentrations and 222Rn activities all indicate higher groundwater fluxes to the Tambo River in areas of increased topographic variation where the potential to form large groundwater--surface water gradients is greater. Groundwater discharge to the Tambo River calculated by Cl mass balance was significantly lower (1.48 {\texttimes} 104 to 1.41 {\texttimes} 103 m3 day-1) than discharge estimated by 222Rn mass balance (5.35 {\texttimes} 105 to 9.56 {\texttimes} 103 m3 day-1) and differential flow gauging (5.41 {\texttimes} 105 to 6.30 {\texttimes} 103 m3 day-1) due to bank return waters. While groundwater sampling from the bank of the Tambo River was intended to account for changes in groundwater chemistry associated with bank infiltration, variations in bank infiltration between sample sites remain unaccounted for, limiting the use of Cl as an effective tracer. Groundwater discharge to both the Tambo and Nicholson rivers was the highest under high-flow conditions in the days to weeks following significant rainfall, indicating that the rivers are well connected to a groundwater system that is responsive to rainfall. Groundwater constituted the lowest proportion of river discharge during times of increased rainfall that followed dry periods, while groundwater constituted the highest proportion of river discharge under baseflow conditions (21.4\% of the Tambo in April 2010 and 18.9\% of the Nicholson in September 2010).},

  abstract = {Most linear inverse problems require regularization to ensure that robust and meaningful solutions can be found. Typically, Tikhonov-style regularization is used, whereby a preference is expressed for models that are somehow `small' and/or `smooth'. The strength of such preferences is expressed through one or more damping parameters, which control the character of the solution, and which must be set by the user. However, identifying appropriate values is often regarded as a matter of art, guided by various heuristics. As a result, such choices have often been the source of controversy and concern. By treating these as hyperparameters within a hierarchical Bayesian framework, we are able to obtain solutions that encompass the range of permissible regularization parameters. Furthermore, we show that these solutions are often well-approximated by those obtained via standard analysis using certain regularization choices which are---in a certain sense---optimal. We obtain algorithms for determining these optimal values in various cases of common interest, and show that they generate solutions with a number of attractive properties. A reference implementation of these algorithms, written in Python, accompanies this paper.},

Our results showclearly that variable thermal conductivity, though small in magnitude as compared to variations in the viscosity, does exert a significant delaying influence on mantle cooling, thereby keeping the Urey ratio low, reducing the growth of the bottom thermal boundary layer, and changing the viscosity profiles over time. A higher temperature at the core-- mantle boundary increases the overall time-dependent behavior of the thermal boundary layers. Enhanced radiative conductivity results in faster cooling, opposite to the effect of the phonon conductivity component and a superadiabatic temperature gradient in the deep lower mantle. Finally, the initial value of the core--mantle boundary temperature can be inferred to wield a strong influence on the subsequent mantle thermal evolution in this model with both variable thermal conductivity and viscosity. We may conjecture that other rheological and conductivity complexities, such as grain-size dependence of mantle properties, would also have an impact on the current state of the mantle resulting from the primordial thermal condition.},

The xenoliths are predominantly foliated and lineated metapelitic (garnet-sillimanite-K-feldspar) granulites. Their metapelitic composition is unusual compared with the mostly mafic composition of lower crustal xenoliths world-wide. Based on thermobarometry, the metapelitic xenoliths were entrained from depths of c. 20-25 {\textpm} 3.5 km and rare mafic granulites from depths of 31-33 {\textpm} 3.4 km. The xenoliths were emplaced during Lower Carboniferous volcanism and are considered to represent samples of the present day lower crust. Vpvalues for the metapelitic granulites range between 6.26 and 7.99 km s-1with a mean value of 7.09 {\textpm} 0.4 km s-1. Psammite and granitic orthogneiss samples have calculated Vpvalues of 6.51 and 6.23 km s-1, respectively. Vsvalues for the metapelites are between 3.86 and 4.34 km s-1, with a mean value of 4.1 {\textpm} 0.15 km s-1. The psammite and orthogneiss have calculated Vsvalues of 3.95 and 3.97 km s-1, respectively. The measured seismic velocities correlate with density and with modal mineralogy, especially the high content of sillimanite and garnet. Vpanisotropy is between 0.15\% and 13.97\%, and a clear compositional control is evident, mainly in relation to sillimanite abundance. Overall Vsanisotropy ranges from 1\% to 11\%. Poisson's ratio ({$\sigma$}) lies between 0.25 and 0.35 for the metapelitic granulites, mainly reflecting a high Vpvalue due to abundant sillimanite in the sample with the highest {$\sigma$}. Anisotropy is probably a function of deformation associated with the closure of the Iapetus ocean in the Silurian as well as later extension in the Devonian. The orientation of the bulk strain ellipsoid in the lower crust is difficult to constrain, but lineation is likely to be NE-SW, given the strike-slip nature of the late Caledonian and subsequent Acadian deformation. When corrected for present-day lower crustal temperature, the experimentally determined Vpvalues correspond well with velocities from the ICSSP, COOLE I and VARNET seismic refraction lines. Near the xenolith localities, the COOLE I line displays two lower crustal layers with in situ Vpvalues of 6.85-6.9 and 6.9-8.0 km s-1, respectively. The upper (lower velocity) layer corresponds well with the metapelitic granulite xenoliths while the lower (higher velocity) layer matches that of the basic granulite xenoliths, though their metamorphic pressures suggest derivation from depths corresponding to the present-day upper mantle. {\copyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {A broad range of controlling mechanisms is described for intraplate basaltic volcanic fields (IBVFs) in the literature. These correspond with those relating to shallow tectonic processes and to deep mantle plumes. Accurate measurement of the physical parameters of intraplate volcanism is fundamental to gain an understanding of the controlling factors that influence the scale and location of a specific IBVF. Detailed volume and geochronology data are required for this; however, these are not available for many IBVFs. In this study the primary controls on magma genesis and transportation are established for the Pliocene--Recent Newer Volcanics Province (NVP) of south-eastern Australia as a case-study for one of such IBVF. The NVP is a large and spatio-temporally complex IBVF that has been described as either being related to a deep mantle plume, or upper mantle and crustal processes. We use innovative high resolution aeromagnetic and 3D modelling analysis, constrained by well-log data, to calculate its dimensions, volume and long-term eruptive flux. Our estimates suggest volcanic deposits cover an area of 23,100 {\textpm} 530 km2 and have a preserved dense rock equivalent of erupted volcanics of least 680 km3, and may have been as large as 900 km3. The long-term mean eruptive flux of the NVP is estimated between 0.15 and 0.20 km3/ka, which is relatively high compared with other IBVFs. Our comparison with other IBVFs shows eruptive fluxes vary up to two orders of magnitude within individual fields. Most examples where a range of eruptive flux is available for an IBVF show a correlation between eruptive flux and the rate of local tectonic processes, suggesting tectonic control. Limited age dating of the NVP has been used to suggest there were pulses in its eruptive flux, which are not resolvable using current data. These changes in eruptive flux are not directly relatable to the rate of any interpreted tectonic driver such as edge-driven convection. However, the NVP and other IBVFs used for comparison have long-term eruptive fluxes that are considerably less than definitive plume-related volcanic systems. Along with their spatio-temporal patterns and other analysis it is suggested that the NVP and the vast majority of low- and high-flux IBVFs appear to be the result of tectonic processes without requiring additional thermal input from a deep mantle source. Considering a control on volcanism by tectonic processes, the range of eruptive flux of IBVFs is related to variations in the rate of the effecting tectonic process, mantle composition, and the size of the mantle source zone where melt generation and accumulation is taking place.},

  abstract = {The Newer Volcanics Province (NVP) is a Pliocene to Recent intra-plate basaltic volcanic field (BVF) that has formed in a compressive tectonic setting ({$\sigma$}v {\textbackslash}textless {$\sigma$}hmin {\textbackslash}textless {$\sigma$}Hmax) and is not readily attributed to a single geodynamic process. A comprehensive spatial analysis of both monogenetic eruption centres and coeval vents of the NVP constrain factors that control the distribution and emplacement of volcanoes. A point-set of 434 eruption centres totalling 726 vents are divided into three geographical sub-provinces for analysis. Kernel density estimation and Poisson nearest neighbour analysis are used to scrutinize the distribution of eruption centres. A simple and novel fitted regression line method is used to determine the orientation of coeval vents, and Hough transform and two-point azimuth methods are used to identify alignments and alignment trends between eruption centres. The distribution of eruption centres and their relative spatial density corresponds with the extent of thinner lithosphere. Eruption centres of the NVP have a clustered distribution whilst smaller sub-sets of eruption centres are distributed more uniformly. The main alignment trends between coeval vents related to individual dikes and between eruption centres related to successive temporally discrete dikes are primarily oriented nearly parallel with pre-existing crustal fault trends. The frequency of volcanic alignments shows faults oriented nearly parallel to the orientation of the regional maximum horizontal compressive stress ({$\sigma$}1) are favourably utilised by intrusions over other fault trends. The depth from which pre-existing faults facilitate dike propagation is not constrained. We interpret they are likely important in preventing dikes from stalling and forming sills under a compressive stress field in the case of the NVP. It is also observed that coeval vent alignments are more strongly aligned in areas overlying consolidated basement relative to areas of poorly consolidated basin sediments. This could be explained by poorly aligned groups of vents being fed by shallow sills, preferentially forming in layered basin sediments.}

We employ a numerical surface process model that includes long-range fluvial transport, hillslope diffusion, and landsliding, in order to quantitatively assess the tectonic, lithological, and structural controls on the landscape evolution and denudation history of SE Australia. We constrain fluvial erosion parameters for our model by fitting river profiles. Rockfall and landsliding are the most important processes controlling the concentration of erosion in river valleys. We therefore model hillslope evolution using a very low diffusion coefficient and a threshold slope for landsliding. The \&\#8220;initial\&\#8221; (prebreakup) topography of the highlands provides a fundamental control on their subsequent evolution, together with the style and rate of fluvial incision. Secondary controls are exerted by lateral variations in lithology and local tectonic uplift along faults. Our modeling results indicate that (1) the observed highlands morphology requires that the drainage divide was established at its present location prior to opening of the Tasman Sea; whether the divide is inherited from Paleozoic orogeny or resulted from Mesozoic syn-rift uplift cannot be established, however; (2) in contrast to traditional interpretations, escarpment retreat does not appear to be the fundamental process eroding the highlands; and (3) the observed barbed river drainage may be imprinted as a result of lithological variation; it does not necessarily evolve through capture. The driving mechanism that is most consistent with the inferred uplift pattern of the southeastern highlands appears to be magmatic underplating.},

  abstract = {Thermochronologic data collected along age-elevation profiles are commonly interpreted as recording temporally variant but spatially constant exhumation rates. However, thermochronologic age-elevation relationships are known to be perturbed by topographic effects and potential changes in relief, which are neglected in the inherently 1-D interpretation commonly applied. Such data thus potentially record both the denudation and relief history of the sampled region but extracting this information is challenging. In a companion paper, we develop a methodology for rigorously interpreting thermochronologic age-elevation profiles in terms of exhumation rates and relief development through time, and to independently quantify the resolution of these constraints. Here we test this approach using a thermochronological dataset consisting of apatite and zircon fission-track and (U-Th)/He data, collected at La Meije Peak in the Pelvoux-Ecrins massif (French Western Alps). Our data and models suggest a three-phase exhumation history in the Pelvoux-Ecrins massif, including a pulse of rapid exhumation at {$\sim$}6-5.5Ma, preceded and followed by more moderate rates of denudation in the order of 0.3-0.4kmMyr-1. This rapid exhumation event appears to occur coevally in other external crystalline massifs in the Alps but is not detected by qualitative inspection of the age-elevation relationships. Both our synthetic results and inversion of the La Meije data strongly suggest that apatite fission-track age-elevation relationships alone cannot resolve both denudation and relief histories independently and that multiple thermochronometers are required. Combining apatite fission-track and (U-Th)/He ages and, particularly, including fission-track-length data greatly improves the resolution of the inferred exhumation histories. Although denudation rates through time and the timing of rate changes are generally well resolved, our data have insufficient resolution to satisfactorily constrain the relief history. Synthetic results reported in the companion paper suggest that the reason for this limitation is that relief increase through valley carving has been insufficient with respect to the regional denudation rates to be unambiguously extracted from the data. {\copyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Surface-process models (SPMs) have the potential to become an important tool in predicting sediment flux to basins, but currently suffer from a lack of quantitative understanding of their controlling parameters, as well as difficulties in identifying landscape properties that can be used to test model predictions. We attempt to constrain the parameter values that enter a SPM by comparing predictions of landscape form las expressed by hypsometric and fractal measures) and process rates obtained for different parameter sets with observations from the south-eastern Australian highlands, a rifted margin mountain belt that has remained tectonically stable during Cenozoic times. We map the hypsometry and fractal characteristics of south-eastern Australia and find that the roughness amplitude (G) correlates well with local relief, whereas the hypsometric integral (H) correlates slightly better with elevation than with relief. The fractal dimension (D) does not correlate with any other morphometric measure and varies randomly throughout the region. Variograms generally show three kinds of scaling behaviour of topography with increasing wavelength, with topography only being truly self-affine at wavelengths between similar to 1 and 10 km. From a review of the available data on long-term denudation rates in south- eastern Australia, we infer that these have been 1-10 m Myr(- 1), and average escarpment retreat rates 0.2-1.0 km Myr(-1), throughout the Cenozoic. Model predictions, using a SPM that includes hillslope diffusion and long-range fluvial transport, suggest that landscape form evolves with time; after an initial phase where D, G and relief increase, all morphometric measures decrease with increasing denudation. The behaviour of G and Hin the models is qualitatively compatible with the observations; D, however, varies predictably in the models, in contrast with its random behaviour in the real world. The observed present- day morphology of SE Australia does not impose quantitative constraints on parameter values. The fractal analyses do impose general conditions of relative parameter values that have to be met in order to create 'realistic' topographies. They also suggest that there is no theoretical basis for including hillslope diffusion in SPMs with a spatial resolution coarser than 1 km. A comparison of the observed denudation and retreat rates with model predictions places order-of-magnitude constraints on parameter values. Thus, data pertaining to landscape evolution are much more valuable than static present- day topography data for calibrating SPMs.},

Diapiric models ascribe most structural features to vertical re-organisation of an inverted crustal density profile created by autochthonous magmatic processes during punctuated episodes of partial convective overturn of the upper and middle crust. Alternatively, uniformitarian models interpret the granitoid-cored domes as oversteepened metamorphic core complexes (MCCs) that formed during periods of active extension between periods of regional Alpine-style thrusting. A review of recent advances in lithostratigraphy and geochronology in the EP shows that the greenstone belts are composed everywhere of a coherent, upward-younging stratigraphy, thereby precluding significant thrusting in the formation of the density inversion that drove partial convective overturn. We present new geological evidence that the domes contain some, or all, of the predictive characteristic features of diapirs, including; chaotic internal geometries of domes with otherwise simple outlines, ring faults along dome margins and in flanking greenstone belts, mushroom-shaped fold flaps around the margins of some domes, and sedimentation in inter-diapir synclines. These data, combined with a thorough review of previously proposed core complex models, show that horizontal tectonic models are inadequate to explain the structural, geometric, geochronological, and metamorphic features of the EP. Rather, an integrated model of punctuated partial convective overturn of the upper and middle crust in response to dominantly magmatic processes is presented to explain the ca. 750 Myr history of the terrane.

The 3.53--3.17 Ga East Pilbara Terrane (EP) represents the ancient nucleus of the craton that formed through three distinct mantle plume events at 3.53--3.43, 3.35--3.29 and 3.27--3.24 Ga. Each plume event resulted in eruption of thick dominantly basaltic volcanic successions on older crust to 3.72 Ga, and melting of crust to generate first tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite (TTG), and then progressively more evolved granitic magmas. In each case, plume magmatism was accompanied by uplift and crustal extension. The combination of conductive heating from below, thermal blanketing from above, and internal heating of buried granitoids during these events led to episodes of partial convective overturn of upper and middle crust. These mantle melting events caused severe depletion of the subcontinental lithospheric mantle, making the EP a stable, buoyant, unsubductable continent by c. 3.2 Ga. Extension accompanying the latest event led to rifting of the protocontinent margins at between 3.2 and 3.17 Ga. After 3.2 Ga, horizontal tectonic forces dominated over vertical forces, as revealed by the geology of the three terranes (Karratha, Sholl and Regal) of the West Pilbara Superterrane. The c. 3.12-Ga Whundo Group of the Sholl Terrane is a fault bounded, 10-km-thick volcanic succession with geochemical characteristics of modern oceanic arcs (including boninites and evidence for flux melting) that indicate steep Archean subduction. At 3.07 Ga, the 3.12-Ga Sholl Terrane, 3.27-Ga Karratha Terrane and c. 3.2-Ga Regal Terrane accreted together and onto the EP during the Prinsep Orogeny. This was followed by development of the De Grey Superbasin -- an intracontinental sag basin and widespread plutonism (2.99--2.93 Ga) as a result of orogenic relaxation and slab break off. Craton-wide compressional deformation at 2.95--2.93 Ga culminated with 2.91-Ga accretion of the 3.18 Ga Kurrana Terrane with the EP. This compression caused amplification of the dome-and-keel structure in the EP. Final cratonization was effected by emplacement of 2.89--2.83 Ga post-tectonic granites.},

  abstract = {The relative rates of creation and destruction of continental crust at subduction zones are a key factor shaping the evolution of continental crust through time. Central America, arguably the best studied place where subduction erosion has been documented, is used here to assess past rates and modes of forearc recycling. Drilling from Guatemala to Costa Rica indicates that subduction erosion has been active since at least the early Miocene. Drilling also shows that the rates of subduction erosion have varied significantly both along strike and through time. The Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 334 to southern Costa Rica documents unprecedented subduction erosion there --- at rates larger than the fastest known rates of forearc accretion. In southern Costa Rica, accelerated subduction erosion of the upper plate initiated when the Panama Fracture Zone/Cocos Ridge, the latter being an over thickened aseismic ridge, arrived at the Middle America Trench. The forearc records this event with an unconformity at 2.2 {\textpm} 0.2 Ma. The recovered shelf sequence overlying the unconformity constrains a short ({\textbackslash}textless 2 Myr) interval of extreme subsidence ({$\sim$} 1200 m) with a rapid pulse occurring during the first {$\sim$} 0.3 Myr. This event removed an estimated 1.2 {\texttimes} 106 km3 of forearc material at a rate of {$\sim$} 1125 km3/Myr/km of trench during a time of rapid ({$\sim$} 1035 m/Myr) contemporaneous shelf sediment accumulation. Detrital apatite fission-track thermochronology on the sediments above the unconformity indicates the pattern of surficial sediment transport during this subduction erosion event. The fission track data show that sediments from the extinct and exhumed volcanic arc -- the Cordillera de Talamanca -- were able to immediately access the growing forearc basin after the onset of the 2.2 Ma subduction erosion event. The onset of subduction of an aseismic ridge as occurred at 2.2 Ma in southern Costa Rica is a fairly common tectonic event along a subduction margin. We suggest that similar rapid pulses of subduction erosion may punctuate the evolution of many margins, contributing disproportionately to crustal recycling at subduction zones. The (poorly) preserved geologic record of paleoforearcs needs to be reassessed with this mechanism in mind. It also implies that continental forearc material may be significantly consumed during short local bursts along a subduction margin, and furthermore, that margins abutting regions of frequent subduction of aseismic ridges, like the regions in the Western Pacific where the Darwin Rise currently subducts, should face disproportionate pulses of future subduction erosion and forearc recycling.},

  abstract = {Lyell would have approved of plate tectonics. Indeed, by implication, he almost anticipated it. Recognizing the connection between climate and the global distribution of land and sea, as Fleming points out (pp. 164-165 of this volume), Lyell explained climatic change in the geological past in terms of changes in the geographical distribution of land and sea -continental drift in disguise. Furthermore, since the paradigm of plate tectonics is founded upon an understanding of processes active at present, whose rates can be measured, then applying them to the past, it is entirely in accord with Lyell's principle that geological 'phenomena should be explained only in terms of causal agencies that are observably effective, both in kind and degree' (Rudwick p. 4 of this volume). In a new synthesis of the Lower Palaeozoic tectonic evolution of the northern Appalachians and British Caledonides, Cees van Staal and his colleagues draw upon the modem analogue of the southeast Asia region. Intriguingly, they are able to turn the comparisons around to predict that the modem tectonic activity of southeast Asia will eventually end up in structures looking much like those of the Appalachian-Caledonian orogenic belt. This carefully argued work, paying close attention to field observations, is in the true tradition of Lyell and is firmly set within his principles. The legacy of Lyell is equally evident in Andrew Scott's paper in which he has literally followed in Lyell's footsteps across to North America. Scott discusses on-going research into the occurrence of reptiles preserved inside the upright trunks of Upper Carboniferous trees at Joggins, Nova Scotia, first discovered by Lyell and Dawson in 1852. Scott examines Lyell's ideas on the formation of coal and brings them up to date using modem analogues from southeast Asia. However, he sounds a note of caution in the use of modem analogues since it has now been established that Carboniferous coal-forming plants had life habits and growth mechanisms that were radically different from those of modem peats. The recognition by Lyell of charcoal in coal deposits resulted only many years later in an understanding of its origin from ancient forest fires. Scott explains how current research on ancient charcoal is providing new insights into climatic change, atmospheric composition, and processes of erosion and sedimentation. Lyell visited Nova Scotia twice during his visits to North America. The influence of Lyell on Nova Scotian geology and the use that Lyell made of his fieldwork in his publications is examined by John Calder. Calder provides us with a succinct account of the Carboniferous evolution of Nova Scotia and places Lyell's observations and conclusions in context. Clearly Nova Scotia provides an important link between Europe and North America. Lyell was impressed by the geology of Nova Scotia and his enthusiasm was reciprocated by the local geologists. Particularly important was the influence that Lyell had on Sir William Dawson who was to become one of Nova Scotia's most important and influential geologists. Lyell used many of his discoveries in Nova Scotia to illustrate subsequent editions of his volumes including his discovery of tetrapods within sandstone-filled lycophyte trunks at Joggins. Unravelling the stratigraphic record was always a fundamental objective of Lyell. His desire to understand rates of sedimentation, rises and fall of land and sea level changes as seen both in ancient rocks and as active processes in the modem world is evident from his field observations as recorded in his diaries, travel, and geological books and papers. Our current understanding of the stratigraphic record has been revolutionized in the past twenty years with the advent of sequence stratigraphy as shown by Chris Wilson. The paper by Wilson looks at how the sequence stratigraphic model evolved and its utility. Wilson argues that the application of sequence stratigraphy has provided us with a revolutionary new way of interpreting the stratigraphical record. However, Wilson adds caution in that a new global stratigraphy, allowing global correlations based upon eustatic signals, is not yet a reality as their recognition can not yet be detected unequivocally in the record. Clearly again Lyell takes us back to looking at the rock record but as he also maintained, we must also consider the processes involved that were responsible for what we observe. This point is amplified by Chris Talbot in a review of salt tectonics in the Zagros mountains of Iran. Talbot notes the parallels between the controversy in Lyell's day about whether ice could flow uphill and the more recent controversy about whether salt can flow across the surface of the land or, indeed, the sea bed. Talbot takes the argument a stage further in demonstrating how field measurements of the rates of salt flow and observations of the domal shapes of extrusions are used to quantify the dynamics of the process. He hints at the possible analogy between salt extrusion and the extrusion and gravity spreading of metamorphic core complexes. This richly illustrated, authoritative account of salt tectonics in a classic area is yet further evidence of Lyell's influence on the approach to modem research. Lyell was much concemed with the most tangible expressions of current geological activity in the form of volcanic eruptions and earthquakes. He spent a major part of his life in the field studying volcanoes in Italy and elsewhere, as Wilson describes on pp. 24-31 of this volume, and he was well aware of their 198 PART 3 destructive power. Mount Etna was of particular significance, so it is an essential part of Lyell's legacy that volcanic activity on Etna should be closely monitored, both to give greater quantitative understanding of the process of eruption and to give predictive power to mitigate the risks from future eruptions. Hazel Rymer is a member of an international, multidisciplinary team of scientists who have set up a huge array of instrumentation to monitor every waking moment of this volcanic giant. Their paper gives a historical account of volcano monitoring and describes the modern techniques being utilized on Etna, which are advancing all the time. This is especially so with satellite measurements, including observations of ground deformation using GPS and SAR, which they confidently expect to revolutionize monitoring methods within the next decade. Bruce Bolt brings a wealth of experience to review the advancement of seismology since Lyell's day. Arguably the most significant advance was the construction of the Milne-Shaw seismograph and its use in a global network of observatories set up at the end of the nineteenth century. This duly advanced to the Worldwide Standardized Seismograph Network in the 1950s which has now evolved into the Global Digital Network of seismograph stations. Bolt traces the history of seismology from the valuable descriptive accounts of earthquakes in Lyell's time to the present day analysis of seismic waveforms which gives detailed information about both the nature of the earthquake itself and the nature of the Earth's interior along the pathways of the seismic waves. Seismology has become one of the most powerfol tools for exploring and imaging the Earth's interior, well beyond anything that Lyell could have dreamed of, and continues to be the main means of monitoring earthquakes, in efforts to mitigate their risks. Earthquake prediction, as Bolt explains, remains elusive despite huge research efforts in recent years. The current view is that it is likely to remain so because of the frictional nature of the earthquake mechanism and the heterogeneity of the Earth's crust. A better strategy for risk mitigation is to concentrate on reducing the vulnerability of the population at risk by means of planning, education and the construction or upgrading of buildings and other structures to appropriate levels of earthquake resistance. Lyell was intensely interested in the antiquity of Man, as Cohen (pp. 83-93) and other authors in Part 1 of this book have made clear. Lyell was also intensely interested in the natural environment since this is the laboratory in which to record and measure geological phenomena active at present which are the basis for understanding the geological past. Lyell was well aware of the power of nature over Man and of human dependence on the Earth for its resources, but there was little regard in Lyell's day for the need to protect the Earth from human activities. Nowadays it is a major issue and Sir John Knill completes this book with a telling essay on Man and the modern environment to make the point that, more than ever, we need to apply Lyell's principles. It is now imperative to understand and quantify the mechanisms of global climate change in the geological past, especially over the last 500 000 years, in order to predict future climate change including the anthropogenic contribution. Equally, geological processes on all scales must be better understood in order to build strategies for the environmental sustainability of the Earth. There is thus a critical role for geologists in modern society. The old textbook shorthand for Lyell's principles that 'the present is the key to the past' has to be turned around into the title of this book: the past is the key to the present -and, indeed, to the future.}

  abstract = {Tectonic modeling is often neglected in the basin modeling workflow and heat flow is most times considered a user input. Such heat flows can, therefore, result in erroneous basin modeling outcomes, resulting in false overoptimistic identification of prospective areas or failure to identify prospects. This is particularly true for areas with limited data control such as frontier basin areas, or deep unexplored plays in mature basins. Three major factors obstruct routinely use. Firstly, because of the focus of most tectonic models on lithosphere scale processes a large range of models, including the McKenzie rift model, fail to take into account effects which are of paramount importance for basement heat flow such as transient effects of sediment infill and erosion, and changes in crustal heat production over time. Secondly, lithosphere tectonic models often fail to allow inversion of basin data, making forward tectonic modeling a cumbersome exercise. Non-vertical sediment movements and 2D and 3D loading effects can play an important role, hampering a unique inversion. Thirdly, lithosphere tectonic models generally fail to aid the user to understand the sensitivity of the model results in terms of basin maturation for permissible ranges of tectonic model parameters and for uncertainties in tectonic scenarios such as absence or presence of underplating or two-layered stretching vs a McKenzie model For this reason, we have developed a multi-1D probabilistic tectonic heat flow model, which is capable of calculating tectonic heat flows, incorporating a variety of tectonic scenarios. The model is capable of inversion of burial histories, calibrated to temperature and maturity data. Calibration and sensitivity analysis is done through Monte Carlo sampling analysis using an experimental design technique for computational efficiency. The tectonic heat flows can easily be used as input for basin modeling in commercially available 3rd party software.},

  abstract = {The development and application of geochronological tools suitable for dating Cenozoic rocks and processes have been instrumental to our understanding of the modern history of Australia. Geochronology reveals a dynamic continent that traced a long and rapid trajectory from a position adjacent to Antarctica in the early Cenozoic to its present position near the tropics. The average travel velocity along this path is revealed by the age of hotspot volcanoes, derived by the K-Ar method, and is complemented by measured geomagnetic pole positions on dated igneous rocks and sedimentary deposits. K-Ar dating of volcanic rocks also provided constraints on rates of landscape evolution before and after volcanism and the timing and pattern of dispersion of lifeincluding human inhabitation. K-Ar geochronological results reveal a history of faunal and floral evolution suggestive of a continent undergoing progressive cooling and dehydration with a few brief warm and humid excursions. In contrast, 40Ar/39Ar, SHRIMP U-Pb, fission-track thermochronology, luminescence techniques, and cosmogenic-isotope methods have played relatively minor roles in reconstructing the chronology of Cenozoic volcanism in Australia. Integrated application of these techniques will be critical to providing more precise constraints on the volcanic history of the continent and its climatic and biological evolution. While Cenozoic volcanism, uplift, and denudation were active along the eastern and southeastern margins, a significant part of Australia west of the Tasman Line remained relatively quiescent. The history of this part of the continent is marked by slow and subdued uplift and subsidence, with subtle displacements along major continental structures, and occasional invasion by shallow seas. Despite the general absence of Cenozoic igneous rocks west of the Tasman Line, Australia (east and west) is blanketed by Cenozoic sedimentary covers and weathering profiles. If we consider weathering as a fourth rock-forming process (in addition to igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary), Australia has one of the most complete Cenozoic rock covers of any continent. Retrieving information recorded in these weathering profiles is essential for unravelling its Cenozoic history. Paleomagnetic studies, calibrated 18O curves, and weathering geochronology by K-Ar, 40Ar/39Ar, and (U-Th)/He provide insights into the imprint of climatic events and tectonic processes and illustrate the importance of erosion and weathering to the formation or enrichment of ore and mineral deposits. Except for diamondiferous lamproites of Western Australia and sapphire-rich volcanic rocks in eastern Australia, all other Cenozoic ore and mineral deposits in Australia are related to weathering and erosion. The widespread weathered blanket in Australia suggests low Cenozoic erosion rates. Numerical constraints on chronology and erosion rates are derived from the cooling and denudation histories retrieved from apatite and zircon fission-track and, more recently, (U-Th-Sm)/He thermochronology and cosmogenic isotope studies. Geochronological studies of veneers of sediments, lake and cave deposits, marine carbonates, organic matter and groundwaters provide information on sediment provenance, subtle tectonic movements, and the Australian Cenozoic climatic history. These studies reveal a continent sensitive to global climatic cycles and subject to active, but subtle, tectonism and erosion. This record shows that Australia suffered periods of extreme aridity during cyclical glaciation at high latitudes and precise dating of arbonate sediments and speleothems reveals the exact timing and duration of these glacial and interglacial periods. Cosmogenic isotopes also provide constraints on the age and migration paths of Australia's limited and finite groundwater resources. Lastly, age information extracted from surficial deposits reveals a protracted history of human occupation.},

The bulk thermal conductivity of sedimentary rocks depends mainly on three factors: (1) their mineralogic and fluid composition, (2) their temperature, and (3) their structure. As shown by a series of measurements on small-scale isotropic samples, the effects of mineralogy and fluid content can be estimated quite accurately using the geometric mean model. However, this estimate does not take into account a possible anisotropy related to various structural effects such as small-scale heterogeneity or crystalline orientation. This anisotropy effect seems especially important in the case of clayey formations: various observations using equilibrium temperature logging, together with classical well logs, can be interpreted as indicating such an effect. The effect appears to depend on depth as would be expected from the major changes occurring in clays during their burial history: compaction, mineralogical transformation and structural reorganization.},

The major changes of plate geometry in the Jurassic, Early Cretaceous, mid-Cretaceous, early Paleocene and early Eocene reflect global events. The pattern of spreading around Australia was determined by two long-standing (earlier Phanerozoic) factors that operated in a counter-clockwise direction: (I) penetration from the northwest by the Tethyan divergent ridge: and (2) rotation from the northeast of the Pacific convergent arc and back-arc. The only new feature of the modern pattern is the deep penetration by the Indian Ocean ridge into eastern Gondwanaland to fragment it into continents in contrast with the pattern up to 160 Ma ago of breaking off micro-continents.},

Deriving such large-scale maps based on lithospheric magnetic field measurements faces the challenge of the masking effect of the core field. In this study, the maps were obtained through analyses in the spectral domain by means of a new regional spatial power spectrum based on the Revised Spherical Cap Harmonic Analysis (R-SCHA) formalism. A series of regional spectral analyses were conducted covering the entire Earth. The R-SCHA surface power spectrum for each region was estimated using the NGDC-720 spherical harmonic (SH) model of the lithospheric magnetic field, which is based on satellite, aeromagnetic, and marine measurements. These observational regional spectra were fitted to a recently proposed statistical expression of the power spectrum of Earth's lithospheric magnetic field, whose free parameters include the thickness and magnetization of the magnetic sources. The resulting global magnetic thickness map is compared to other crustal and magnetic thickness maps based upon different geophysical data. We conclude that the large-scale magnetic thickness of the lithosphere is on average confined to a layer that does not exceed the Moho.},

In this work we address RHP variability of some common lithological groups from a compilation of a total of 2188 representative U, Th and K concentrations of different worldwide rock types derived from 102 published studies. To optimize the use of the generated RHP database we have classified and renamed the rock-type denominations of the original works following a petrologic classification scheme with a hierarchical structure. The RHP data of each lithological group is presented in cumulative distribution plots, and we report a table with the mean, the standard deviation, the minimum and maximum values, and the significant percentiles of these lithological groups. We discuss the reported RHP distribution for the different igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic lithological groups from a petrogenetic viewpoint and give some useful guidelines to assign RHP values to lithospheric thermal modeling.},

However, the evidence for this conception is mostly based on samples from the northern Pacific ridges. Here we report Sr, Nd and Pb isotope data from the Pacific Antarctic ridge that reveal different isotopic signatures north and south of the Easter microplate (25{$^\circ$} S). The evidence for two large-scale geochemical domains is further strengthened by the observation of different average depths of the ridge axes north and south of the 25{$^\circ$} S boundary. This boundary is located at the southeastern end of the Darwin rise/Pacific Superswell area6, which is interpreted as a zone of upwelling7 from the lower mantle that has persisted since Cretaceous times. We propose that this upwelling has led to the separation into two mantle domains with their own convective histories, producing slight differences in their average isotopic signatures and thermal regimes.},

  abstract = {Fluid flow in the Earth's crust plays an important role in a number of geological processes. In relatively tight rock formations such flow is usually controlled by open macrofractures, with significant implications for ground water flow and hydrocarbon reservoir management. The movement of fluids in the fractured media will result in changes in the pore pressure and consequently will cause changes to the effective stress, traction and elastic properties. The main purpose of this study is to numerically examine the effect of pore pressure changes on seismic wave propagation (i.e. the effects of pore pressures on amplitude, arrival time, frequency content). This is achieved by using dual simulations of fluid flow and seismic propagation in a common 2-D fracture network. Note that the dual simulations are performed separately as the coupled simulations of fluid flow and seismic wave propagations in such fracture network is not possible because the timescales of fluid flow and wave propagation are considerably different (typically, fluid flows in hours, whereas wave propagation in seconds). The flow simulation updates the pore pressure at consecutive time steps, and thus the elastic properties of the rock, for the seismic modelling. In other words, during each time step of the flow simulations, we compute the elastic response corresponding to the pore pressure distribution. The relationship between pore pressure and fractures is linked via an empirical relationship given by Schoenberg and the elastic response of fractures is computed using the equivalent medium theory described by Hudson and Liu. Therefore, we can evaluate the possibility of inferring the changes of fluid properties directly from seismic data. Our results indicate that P waves are not as sensitive to pore pressure changes as S and coda (or scattered) waves. The increase in pore pressure causes a shift of the energy towards lower frequencies, as shown from the spectrum (as a result of scattering attenuation). Another important observation is that the fluid effects on the wavefield vary significantly with the source-receiver direction, that is, the azimuth relative to the fracture orientation. These results have significant implications for the characterization of naturally fractured reservoirs using seismic methods, and may impact on experimental design to infer such attributes in a real reservoir situation, particularly in acquiring time-lapse seismic data.},

Based on numerical experiments we suggest that serpentinized mantle, formed in the outer rise regions of subduction zones, may provide a mechanically weak horizon within which basal detachment of the oceanic crust is feasible. Deformation of this serpentinized layer may lead to decoupling and separation of oceanic crust from the downgoing slab. Fragments of the former oceanic crust can underplate the accretionary wedge or be exposed on continental crust, whereas the skinned lithospheric part of the slab subducts into the mantle. {\copyright} 2014 Geological Society of America.}

  abstract = {A tectonic and sedimentary facies model is proposed to explain progressive evolution of the late Proterozoic to early Paleozoic Adelaide Rift (Geosyncline) of southern Australia. Tectonic and stratigraphic similarities are noted between the Adelaide Rift and many post Permian rifts and passive continental margins. Also the time span of the pre oceaniccrust accretion stage of the rifting process may be of the same order of magnitude, both in the Adelaide Rift and in post-Permian passive margins. These observations suggest that the underlying cause of the rifting process and the resultant crustal response have not changed significantly since late Precambrian times. More specifically the so-called ``breakup unconformity'', observed in stratigraphic sequences beneath many present day passive continental margins, has been shown by various authors to correlate in time with earliest oceanic crust accretion, and it often separates underlying non-marine or paralic from fully marine shelf strata. In the Adelaide Rift, the unconformable Precambrian---Cambrian boundary is proposed as the analogue of this breakup unconformity, thereby explaining the apparently sudden influx of largely marine metazoans in Cambrian strata immediately above this unconformity.}

  abstract = {At ocean margins where two plates converge, the oceanic plate sinks or is subducted beneath an upper one topped by a layer of terrestrial crust. This crust is constructed of continental or island arc material. The subduction process either builds juvenile masses of terrestrial crust through arc volcanism or new areas of crust through the piling up of accretionary masses (prisms) of sedimentary deposits and fragments of thicker crustal bodies scraped off the subducting lower plate. At convergent margins, terrestrial material can also bypass the accretionary prism as a result of sediment subduction, and terrestrial matter can be removed from the upper plate by processes of subduction erosion. Sediment subduction occurs where sediment remains attached to the subducting oceanic plate and underthrusts the seaward position of the upper plate's resistive buttress (backstop) of consolidated sediment and rock. Sediment subduction occurs at two types of convergent margins: type 1 margins where accretionary prisms form and type 2 margins where little net accretion takes place. At type 2 margins ({$\sim$}19,000 km in global length), effectively all incoming sediment is subducted beneath the massif of basement or framework rocks forming the landward trench slope. At accreting or type 1 margins, sediment subduction begins at the seaward position of an active buttress of consolidated accretionary material that accumulated in front of a starting or core buttress of framework rocks. Where small-to-medium-sized prisms have formed ({$\sim$}16,300 km), approximately 20\% of the incoming sediment is skimmed off a detachment surface or decollement and frontally accreted to the active buttress. The remaining 80\% subducts beneath the buttress and may either underplate older parts of the frontal body or bypass the prism entirely and underthrust the leading edge of the margin's rock framework. At margins bordered by large prisms ({$\sim$}8,200 km), roughly 70\% of the incoming trench floor section is subducted beneath the frontal accretionary body and its active buttress. In rounded figures the contemporary rate of solid-volume sediment subduction at convergent ocean margins ({$\sim$}43,500 km) is calculated to be 1.5 km{$^3$}/yr. Correcting type 1 margins for high rates of terrigenous seafloor sedimentation during the past 30 m.y. or so sets the long-term rate of sediment subduction at 1.0 km{$^3$}/yr. The bulk of the subducted material is derived directly or indirectly from continental denudation. Interstitial water currently expulsed from accreted and deeply subducted sediment and recycled to the ocean basins is estimated at 0.9 km{$^3$}/yr. The thinning and truncation caused by subduction erosion of the margin's framework rock and overlying sedimentary deposits have been demonstrated at many convergent margins but only off northern Japan, central Peru, and northern Chile has sufficient information been collected to determine average or long-term rates, which range from 25 to 50 km{$^3$}/m.y. per kilometer of margin. A conservative long-term rate applicable to many sectors of convergent margins is 30 km{$^3$}/km/m.y. If applied to the length of type 2 margins, subduction erosion removes and transports approximately 0.6 km{$^3$}/yr of upper plate material to greater depths. At various places, subduction erosion also affects sectors of type 1 margins bordered by small- to medium-sized accretionary prisms (for example, Japan and Peru), thus increasing the global rate by possibly 0.5 km{$^3$}/yr to a total of 1.1 km{$^3$}/yr. Little information is available to assess subduction erosion at margins bordered by large accretionary prisms. Mass balance calculations allow assessments to be made of the amount of subducted sediment that bypasses the prism and underthrusts the margin's rock framework. This subcrustally subducted sediment is estimated at 0.7 km{$^3$}/yr. Combined with the range of terrestrial matter removed from the margin's rock framework by subduction erosion, the global volume of subcrustally subducted material is estimated to range from 1.3 to 1.8 km{$^3$}/yr. Subcrustally subducted material is either returned to the terrestrial crust by arc-related igneous processes or crustal underplating or is lost from the crust by mantle absorption. Geochemical and isotopic data support the notion that upper mantle melting returns only a small percent of the subducted material to the terrestrial crust as arc igneous rocks. Limited areal exposures of terrestrial rocks metamorphosed at deep ({\textbackslash}textgreater20--30 km) subcrustal pressures and temperatures imply that only a small fraction of subducted material is reattached via deep crustal underplating. Possibly, therefore much of the subducted terrestrial material is recycled to the mantle at a rate near 1.6 km{$^3$}/yr, which is effectively equivalent to the commonly estimated rate at which the mantle adds juvenile igneous material to the Earth's layer of terrestrial rock.

  abstract = {Transient thermal signals such as Pleistocene surface temperature variations or exhumation of great rock volumes are important for the current thermal regime of the Eastern Alpine crust. In this study transient 1-D forward simulations and an analytical approach were used to estimate the order of magnitude of these effects. A comparison with numerical forward simulations and inverse analyses of steady-state heat conduction yields the following main conclusions with respect to the thermal regime of the Eastern Alps along the TRANSALP profile: (1) The change of surface temperatures in the past affects mainly the uppermost part of the Eastern Alpine crust. It results in a maximum thermal signature of more than - 6 K at a depth of 2 km. The deviations from a steady-state temperature gradient and heat flow in the region of the Tauern Window range from 0.3--4 K km- 1 and 0--6 mW m- 2, respectively, with maximum values at the surface. (2) Exhumation of the Eastern Alpine lithosphere may result in a thermal signature of up to 4 K at a depth of 1 km. The thermal signature increases further with depth to a maximum of approximately 80 K at a depth of 50 km. As the temperature gradient of the exhumation signal is almost zero at the base of the crust, Moho heat flow appears to be not critically perturbed. (3) The combined effect of exhumation and changing surface temperatures at the Tauern Window amounts to less than 15\% of the steady-state temperatures at a depth of {$\sim$} 8 km and to less than 10\% at the base of Eastern Alpine root. The corresponding perturbation in heat flow is less than 20\% at a depth of 4 km, approaching zero below 40 km.},

  abstract = {The notion of sediment-transport capacity has been engrained in geomorphological and related literature for over 50 years, although its earliest roots date back explicitly to Gilbert in fluvial geomorphology in the 1870s and implicitly to eighteenth to nineteenth century developments in engineering. Despite cross fertilization between different process domains, there seem to have been independent inventions of the idea in aeolian geomorphology by Bagnold in the 1930s and in hillslope studies by Ellison in the 1940s. Here we review the invention and development of the idea of transport capacity in the fluvial, aeolian, coastal, hillslope, d{\'e}bris flow, and glacial process domains. As these various developments have occurred, different definitions have been used, which makes it both a difficult concept to test, and one that may lead to poor communications between those working in different domains of geomorphology. We argue that the original relation between the power of a flow and its ability to transport sediment can be challenged for three reasons. First, as sediment becomes entrained in a flow, the nature of the flow changes and so it is unreasonable to link the capacity of the water or wind only to the ability of the fluid to move sediment. Secondly, environmental sediment transport is complicated, and the range of processes involved in most movements means that simple relationships are unlikely to hold, not least because the movement of sediment often changes the substrate, which in turn affects the flow conditions. Thirdly, the inherently stochastic nature of sediment transport means that any capacity relationships do not scale either in time or in space. Consequently, new theories of sediment transport are needed to improve understanding and prediction and to guide measurement and management of all geomorphic systems.},

Unraveling the evolution of these suture zone fault systems yields valuable information regarding the relative importance of various upper crustal structures and their linkage through the lithosphere. We present new bedrock geologic mapping and geochronology data documenting the geologic evolution of reactivated shortening structures and adjacent metamorphic rocks in the Alaska Range suture zone at the inboard margin of the Wrangellia composite terrane in the eastern Alaska Range, Alaska, USA. Detrital zircon uranium-lead (U-Pb) age spectra from metamorphic rocks in our study area reveal two distinct metasedimentary belts. The Maclaren schist occupies the inboard (northern) belt, which was derived from terranes along the western margin of North America during the mid- to Late Cretaceous. In contrast, the Clearwater metasediments occupy the outboard (southern) belt, which was derived from arcs built on the Wrangellia composite terrane during the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous. A newly discovered locality of Alaska-type zoned ultramafic bodies within the Clearwater metasediments provides an additional link to the Wrangellia composite terrane. The Maclaren and Clearwater metasedimentary belts are presently juxtaposed by the newly identified Valdez Creek fault, which is an upper crustal reactivation of the Valdez Creek shear zone, the Late Cretaceous plate boundary that initially brought them together. 40Ar/39Ar mica ages reveal independent post-collisional thermal histories of hanging wall and footwall rocks until reactivation localized on the Valdez Creek fault after ca. 32 Ma. Slip on the Valdez Creek fault expanded into a thrust system that progressed southward to the Broxson Gulch fault at the southern margin of the suture zone and eventually into the Wrangellia terrane. Detrital zircon U-Pb age spectra and clast assemblages from fault-bounded Cenozoic gravel deposits indicate that the thrust system was active during the Oligocene and into the Pliocene, likely as a far-field result of ongoing flat-slab subduction and accretion of the Yakutat microplate. The Valdez Creek fault was the primary reactivated structure in the suture zone, likely due to its linkage with the reactivated boundary zone between the Wrangellia composite terrane and North America in the lithospheric mantle.},

In this study we developed a new second-order NMM model to solve the nonlinear problem of water flow with the free surface priori unknown and the difficulty of modeling drains which could dramatically increase the meshing load. Our study consist of: (1) deriving two forms of NMM second-order approximation; (2) constructing the total potential energy for water flow by our energy-work seepage model considering Dirichlet, Neumann and material boundaries uniformly; (3) locating free surface nodes in two forms of second-order approximation; (4) tracking the free surface with an efficient iteration scheme without re-meshing; (5) deriving velocity and tunnel flux by second-order approximation. We developed a new code and demonstrate our model and code with examples including confined drainage tunnel and free surface flow through a dam. We compare the results such as tunnel flux or free surface with linear NMM, analytical or other available numerical solutions. We prove that: the two forms of second-order NMM (1) yield consistent results; (2) for modeling drains involving local intensive change, could achieve accurate result of tunnel flux calculation and dramatically save computation load with linear velocity distribution in coarse mesh; (3) for free surface iteration, are efficient with fast convergence to accurate results and with rather coarse mesh. As a result, our second-order NMM model is applicable to free surface flow with inner drains for free surface locating and flux calculation, and seepage stability analysis, laying a solid foundation for extending to coupled hydro-mechanical analysis.},

  abstract = {A Bayesian inference approach is presented for the solution of the inverse heat conduction problem. The posterior probability density function (PPDF) of the boundary heat flux is computed given temperature measurements within a conducting solid. Uncertainty in temperature measurements is modeled as stationary zero-mean white noise. The inverse solution is obtained by computing the expectation of the PPDF. The posterior state space is exploited using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms in order to obtain estimates of the statistics of the unknown heat flux. The MCMC sampling strategy enables the extension of the Bayesian inference approach to inverse problems having high-dimensional, non-standard distribution, and/or complex PPDFs. The ill-posedness (un-identifability) of the inverse problem is cured through prior distribution modeling (Bayesian prior regularization) of the unknown heat flux. A special model of Markov random eld (MRF) is adopted for prior distribution modeling of the unknown heat flux. An augmented Bayesian model is proposed for estimating the statistics of the measurement noise as well as the unknown heat flux. Two inverse heat conduction examples are presented to demonstrate the potential of the MCMC-based Bayesian approach. The simulation results indicate that MRF provides an effective prior regularization, the estimates using MCMC samples are accurate and the Bayesian approach captures very well the probability distribution of the unknown heat flux.}

  abstract = {Identification and removal of surface depressions is a critical step for automated modelling of surface rainfall runoff based on Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). At present, nearly all GIS and hydrologic software packages employ Jenson and Domingue's method for preparing depressionless DEMs for hydrologic analysis. This conventional method is computationally intensive and time-consuming. With the growing availability of high-resolution DEMs produced by airborne LIDAR and InSAR techniques, GIS-based hydrologic applications often need to handle larger geographic areas at finer resolutions. In the face of high-resolution DEMs, the conventional method becomes inadequate and deficient. In this paper, we present a new method for efficiently identifying and filling surface depressions in DEMs. This method can simultaneously determine flow paths and spatial partition of watersheds with one pass of processing. A novel concept of spill elevation and the least-cost search for optimal flow paths are the two cornerstones of our method. The time complexity of our method is in O(Nlog N). It has been implemented using C+ + programming language and successfully applied to USGS DEMs and LIDAR DEMs of various sizes. Experiments show that our method outperforms the conventional method by a factor of over 30, in terms of running time},

  abstract = {The isotopic characteristics of the sub-oceanic mantle are well established, but in continental regions these properties are usually obscured, and therefore controversial, because of the potential effects of crustal contamination together with lithospheric mantle metasomatism and melting. The so-called EM1 (Enriched Mantle-1) signature, characterized by low 206Pb/204Pb and 143Nd/144Nd ratios, is particularly problematic in this respect because EM1-type OIB sources are commonly attributed to recycled crust and/or lithospheric mantle. In this paper we show that a suite of Cenozoic potassic basalts from NE China displays many previously unrecognized correlations between chemical and isotopic parameters, which tightly constrain the isotopic characteristics of an extreme EM1-type mantle source located in the asthenosphere. Its radiogenic isotopes are similar to, but even more extreme than, those of the oceanic endmember composition represented by the Pitcairn hotspot, namely 206Pb/204Pb {$\leq$} 16.5, 143Nd/144Nd {$\leq$} 0.5123 (or {$\epsilon$}Nd{$\leq-$}6.4), 176Hf/177Hf {$\leq$} 0.2825 (or {$\epsilon$}Hf{$\leq-$}10.1). These characteristics require a source of recycled crustal material of Precambrian age ({$\sim$}2.2 Ga). An important new constraint is the Mg isotopic composition of {$\delta$}26Mg ({$\leq-$}0.6‚Ä∞), which is lower than normal mantle ({$\delta$}26Mg=-0.25{\textpm}0.07‚Ä∞) and lower crustal values ({$\delta$}26Mg=-0.29{\textpm}0.15‚Ä∞), but consistent with sedimentary carbonate ({$\delta$}26Mg=-5.57‚Ä∞ to -0.38‚Ä∞). The endmember EM1 source produced high-SiO2 melts with low MgO, CaO/Al2O3 and {$\delta$}26Mg values, exceptionally high K/U {$\cong$} 50,000, Ba/Th {$\cong$} 400, low U/Pb {$\cong$} 0.06, and positive Zr and Hf anomalies. The chemical and isotopic parameters of this potassic basalt suite form binary mixing arrays, one end point of which is the inferred asthenospheric EM1 reservoir, whereas the other is a more ordinary, depleted mantle component, which is also sampled by local lithospheric mantle xenoliths. These binary arrays include well-developed correlations between Sr, Nd, Hf, Pb and Mg isotopes, negative correlations of 206Pb/204Pb with K2O, K/U, Hf/Hf‚Åé, positive correlations of {$\delta$}26Mg with MgO, and 143Nd/144Nd with Fe2O3T and U/Pb. We propose that the EM1 reservoir contains recycled ancient carbonate-bearing sediments, subducted into the mantle transition zone, where K, Rb, Ba and Pb are sequestered by K-hollandite as suggested by Murphy et al. (2002) for the Gaussberg lamproites. Loss of small amounts of carbonate melt extracted Th, U and some of the LREE, while retaining K, Rb, Ba, Pb, Zr and Hf in the residue, thereby generating the observed trace element anomalies. In Cenozoic time, this deep EM1 reservoir ascended into the shallow asthenosphere and underwent low-degree partial melting, at pressures below the stability field of K-hollandite, thereby releasing K, Rb and Ba into the melt. The partial melts ascended through subcontinental lithosphere and were progressively modified by interaction with the lithospheric mantle, thus accounting for the linear chemical and isotopic trends noted above. This interaction imposed a progressively more depleted character on the erupted melt, both in terms of isotopic composition and trace element enrichment.}

  abstract = {Rupture-zone averaged static stress drop in the 2011 M=9 Tohoku-Oki earthquake was less than 5 MPa, but it caused a stress reversal in most of the offshore forearc, although the reversal is less well constrained far offshore by earthquake mechanisms because of 20- to 30-km errors in event depths. Using a finite element model of force balance, we demonstrate that the stress reversal unambiguously indicates (1) a very weak subduction megathrust and (2) very low differential stresses in the forearc. Prior to the reversal, the upper limit of megathrust strength could not be determined from forearc stresses. In the forearc, effects of megathrust friction and gravity are in a fragile balance, and stresses fluctuate around a neutral state in earthquake cycles. If most of the offshore forearc is to be compressive before but extensional after the earthquake, the effective friction coefficient of the megathrust must be {\textasciitilde}0.032. Under low differential stresses associated with megathrust weakness, the forearc is generally well below yielding. Applying the concepts of dynamic Coulomb wedge, we show that the inner wedge, and by inference farther landward, stays stable throughout earthquake cycles. The outer wedge is stable most of the time but may occasionally enter a critical state during great earthquakes; its geometry suggests that complete stress drop of the underlying shallow megathrust is unlikely to have happened. We reason that the occurrence of earthquakes and active faulting under low stress in the stable forearc is due to heterogeneities in structure, stress, and/or pore fluid pressure.},

  abstract = {Quantitative interpretation of the tidal response of water levels measured in wells has long been made either with a model for perfectly confined aquifers or with a model for purely unconfined aquifers. However, many aquifers may be neither totally confined nor purely unconfined at the frequencies of tidal loading but behave somewhere between the two end-members. Here we present a more general model for the tidal response of groundwater in aquifers with both horizontal flow and vertical leakage. The model has three independent parameters: the transmissivity (T) and storativity (S) of the aquifer and the specific leakage (K{$\prime$}/b{$\prime$}) of the leaking aquitard, where K{$\prime$} and b{$\prime$} are the hydraulic conductivity and the thickness of the aquitard, respectively. If T and S are known independently, this model may be used to estimate aquitard leakage from the phase shift and amplitude ratio of water level in wells obtained from tidal analysis. We apply the model to interpret the tidal response of water level in a US Geological Survey (USGS) deep monitoring well installed in the Arbuckle aquifer in Oklahoma, into which massive amount of wastewater coproduced from hydrocarbon exploration has been injected. The analysis shows that the Arbuckle aquifer is leaking significantly at this site. We suggest that the present method may be effective and economical for monitoring leakage in groundwater systems, which bears on the safety of water resources, the security of underground waste repositories, and the outflow of wastewater during deep injection and hydrocarbon extraction.},

For the Bowen and Gunnedah Basins, a quantitative analysis of the early Late Permian to Middle Triassic foreland loading phase examined the relative roles of static loading vs dynamic loading associated with the convergent plate margin. Subsidence in the initial foreland phase in the early Late Permian is consistent with platform tilting due to corner flow in the mantle associated with west-directed subduction. Later in the Late Permian, platform tilting probably continued to be the dominant cause of subsidence, but increasing amounts of subsidence due to foreland loading occurred as the thrust front in the New England Orogen migrated westward. In the latest Permian and Early Triassic, static flexural loading due to foreland loads is dominant and may be the sole cause for basin subsidence. For the Surat and Eromanga Basins, the tectonic subsidence across an east--west transect is modelled to assess the contribution of dynamically induced platform tilting, due to viscous mantle corner flow, in basin subsidence. The modelling suggests that subsidence was again controlled by dynamic platform tilting, which provides a mechanism for both the near-field and far-field effects. Uplift of the Eastern Highlands in the mid-Cretaceous may also be related to viscous corner flow driven by west-directed subduction beneath eastern Australia, with the uplift being due to rebound of the lithosphere after the cessation of subduction.},

  abstract = {Plate flexure is a phenomenon that describes how the lithosphere responds to long-term ({\textbackslash}textgreater 105 yr) geological loads. By comparing the flexure in the vicinity of ice, volcano, and sediment loads to predictions based on simple plate models it has been possible to estimate the effective elastic thickness of the lithosphere, Te. In the oceans, Te is the range 2-50 km and is determined mainly by plate and load age. The continents, in contrast, are characterised by Te values of up to 80 km and greater. Rheological considerations based on data from experimental rock mechanics suggest that Te reflects the integrated brittle, elastic and ductile strength of the lithosphere. Te differs, therefore, from the seismogenic layer thickness, Ts, which is indicative of the depth to which anelastic deformation occurs as unstable frictional sliding. Despite differences in their time scales, Te and Ts are similar in the oceans where loading reduces the initial mechanical thickness to values that generally coincide with the thickness of the brittle layer. They differ, however, in continents, which, unlike oceans, are characterised by a multi-layer rheology. As a result, Te ??? Ts in cratons, many convergent zones, and some rifts. Most rifts, however, are characterised by a low Te that has been variously attributed to a young thermal age of the rifted lithosphere, thinning and heating at the time of rifting, and yielding due to post-rift sediment loading. Irrespective of their origin, the Wilson cycle makes it possible for low values to be inherited by foreland basins which, in turn, helps explain why similarities between Te and Ts extend beyond rifts into other tectonic regions such as orogenic belts and, occasionally, the cratons themselves. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Relative traveltime residuals are calculated from the data set of the Irish Seismological Lithospheric Experiment (ISLE 2002/3) and permanent stations onshore Ireland. At each of the 28 station sites, a local crustal 1-D P-wave velocity (v{\textbackslash}textlessinf{\textbackslash}textgreaterP{\textbackslash}textless/inf{\textbackslash}textgreater) model is determined because the 3-D crustal v{\textbackslash}textlessinf{\textbackslash}textgreaterP{\textbackslash}textless/inf{\textbackslash}textgreater structure of Ireland is well known. These 1-D models are used for a traveltime correction for crustal effects. The corrected residuals indicate two large-scale traveltime anomalies of low amplitude: a negative traveltime anomaly in the western part of Ireland and a positive anomaly in the eastern part of the country. The subsequent traveltime tomography is calculated using an iterative non-linear inversion using a variable parametrization and 3-D ray tracing. Our inversion result contains a low P-wave velocity (v{\textbackslash}textlessinf{\textbackslash}textgreaterP{\textbackslash}textless/inf{\textbackslash}textgreater) zone underneath central Ireland, at 31-120 km depth. The amplitudes of the low velocity zone reach up to -2.5 per cent v{\textbackslash}textlessinf{\textbackslash}textgreaterP{\textbackslash}textless/inf{\textbackslash}textgreater at 31-60 km depth, but decrease to -0.5 to -1 per cent v{\textbackslash}textlessinf{\textbackslash}textgreaterP{\textbackslash}textless/inf{\textbackslash}textgreater at 120-150 km depth. Reconstruction tests confirm that large anomalies in our model are well resolved, although the resolution decreases towards the edges of the model. We infer that the low velocity zone underneath central Ireland is related to lithospheric thinning towards the north, which was determined by a previous S-receiver function study. This anomaly is interpreted as presumably ancient or even recent mantle upwelling, related to the spreading of the Iceland plume head. \&copy; 2008 The Authors Journal compilation \&copy; 2008 RAS.},

  abstract = {Mantle melting, which leads to the formation of oceanic and continental crust, together with crust recycling through plate tectonics, are the primary processes that drive the chemical differentiation of the silicate Earth. The present-day mantle, as sampled by oceanic basalts, shows large chemical and isotopic variability bounded by a few end-member compositions. Among these, the HIMU end-member (having a high U/Pb ratio, {$\mu$}) has been generally considered to represent subducted/recycled basaltic oceanic crust. However, this concept has been challenged by recent studies of the mantle source of HIMU magmas. For example, analyses of olivine phenocrysts in HIMU lavas indicate derivation from the partial melting of peridotite, rather than from the pyroxenitic remnants of recycled oceanic basalt. Here we report data that elucidate the source of these lavas: high-precision trace-element analyses of olivine phenocrysts point to peridotite that has been metasomatized by carbonatite fluids. Moreover, similarities in the trace-element patterns of carbonatitic melt inclusions in diamonds and HIMU lavas indicate that the metasomatism occurred in the subcontinental lithospheric mantle, fused to the base of the continental crust and isolated from mantle convection. Taking into account evidence from sulfur isotope data for Archean to early Proterozoic surface material in the deep HIMU mantle source, a multi-stage evolution is revealed for the HIMU end-member, spanning more than half of Earth's history. Before entrainment in the convecting mantle, storage in a boundary layer, upwelling as a mantle plume and partial melting to become ocean island basalt, the HIMU source formed as Archean-early Proterozoic subduction-related carbonatite-metasomatized subcontinental lithospheric mantle. 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.}

The uplift of the Eastern Highlands is thought to have taken place in three sub-equal stages, starting in the middle Mesozoic. The last uplift is inferred to have begun some time after the Oligocene, and to have resulted in less than 300 m of uplift in the central and southern parts of the highlands, and negligible uplift in the northern.

  abstract = {Hot spots and the seamounts produced by them provide both geometric and temporal evidence for changes in absolute plate motion. The main limitation in using hot-spot-produced seamounts in plate tectonic reconstructions arises from the multiple sources of error and ambiguity that plague radiometric age estimates. In particular, unless the hot spot has maintained a steady and voluminous flux rate over long periods of time, the exact location of a hot spot (which represents the zero age origin along the hot spot trail) is poorly known. Here, we discuss a unique geometric relationship between a hot spot and the seamounts produced by it that we recently have discovered, i.e. hot-spot-produced seamounts have seafloor crustal flow lines that intersect at the hot spot location. Furthermore, we obtain images of cumulative volcano amplitudes (CVA) by convolving seamount shapes with their flow lines; hot spots correspond to clear local maxima in this image and the amplitudes are proportional to cumulative hot spot flux. This technique, dubbed 'hot-spotting', allows us to determine hot spot locations based only on a set of seamount locations; no age information is required. We use the hot-spotting technique to examine the Pacific plate hot spots in general and the Bowie and Cobb hot spots in the Gulf of Alaska in particular. We find that the Hawaii, Louisville, Caroline, Cobb and Bowie hot spots have clear representations in the CVA images. Rurutu and/or Rarotonga are close to a large CVA high, while the other French Polynesian hot spots in general exhibit a much more subdued and blurred expression. We also conclude that the Cobb hot-spot plume may have been entrained by the Juan de Fuca Ridge about 2 Ma ago or, alternatively, is in a waning phase and cannot penetrate Juan de Fuca plate lithoshpere. The Bowie hot spot appears to have encountered the ridge more recently.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-{$\alpha$}-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD {$\leq$} 2.0 {\textbackslash}AA for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

  abstract = {Raw heat flow measurements typically require correction for both palaeoclimate and topography if temperatures are to be reliably extrapolated to depths greater than those where temperature is measured. Such corrections are thus an essential step in quantifying geothermal energy resources. However, although both types of correction were pioneered decades ago by British workers, they have been omitted or underplayed in subsequent assessments of the UK geothermal dataset. Furthermore, as most UK heat flow measurements to date have utilised shallow boreholes, the magnitudes of the required corrections (for both effects) are exacerbated. In addition, the location of Britain, at a range of latitude with a temperate climate at present but where arctic conditions prevailed during much of the Pleistocene, means that the palaeoclimate correction, for a borehole of a given depth, is particularly large. Outside regions of high relief relative to borehole depth, palaeoclimate corrections at sites in Britain are indeed larger in magnitude than topographic corrections, and for almost all boreholes are additive. The magnitude of the palaeoclimate correction depends on assumptions about palaeotemperature anomalies and their durations, but from the available evidence it can be assessed, for a very shallow borehole in an unglaciated part of southern Britain with rocks of thermal conductivity 3Wm-1??C-1, as 27mWm-2. Air temperatures during Pleistocene cold stages decreased northward, but in much of northern Britain the Earth's surface was not exposed to these low temperatures for part of the Late Pleistocene due to the insulating effect of cover by ice sheets; the detailed correction for each locality thus depends on the local histories of air temperature anomalies and of ice cover, and may therefore potentially be greater or less than is typical for southern England. The past failure to recognise the magnitude of palaeoclimate corrections at sites in Britain, and to incorporate them into studies of geothermics, has led to systematic underestimation of temperatures at depth and, thus, of the overall geothermal energy resource. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Absent clear lithologic control, the presence of elevated, low-relief topography in upland landscapes has traditionally been interpreted as a signature of relative surface uplift and incision of a paleo-landscape. Such interpretations are commonly supported and quantified using analyses of river longitudinal profiles under the assumption of a static drainage network topology. Drainage networks, however, are not static, and it has been proposed recently that divide migration and drainage capture can lead to the generation of low-relief upland topography that mimics that of incised paleo-landscapes and that might be falsely interpreted as recording surface uplift and/or the onset of accelerated incision. Indeed, the interpretation of the incised southeastern Tibetan Plateau, and thus the associated geodynamic implications, have been called into question. Here we use theory and one- and two-dimensional landscape evolution models to develop a set of morphometric criteria to distinguish these alternative mechanisms of low-relief upland formation. Application to the southeastern Tibetan Plateau illustrates the utility of these metrics and demonstrates that the topography is in no way consistent with the drainage network dynamics mechanism and is fully consistent with incision into an elevated, preexisting low-relief landscape.}

Rare earth element inversions of the melt distribution in the mantle source region suggest that sufficient melt is generated under normal oceanic spreading centers to produce an 8.3 +/- 1.5 km thick igneous crust. The difference between the thickness estimates from seismics and from rare earth element inversions is not significant given the uncertainties in the mantle source composition, though it is of the magnitude that would be expected if partial melt fractions of about 1\% remain in the mantle and are not extracted to the overlying crust. The inferred igneous thickness increases to 10.3 +/- 1.7 km (seismic measurements) and 10.7 +/- 1.6 km (rare earth element inversions) where spreading centers intersect the regions of hotter than normal mantle surrounding mantle plumes. This is consistent with melt generation by decompression of the hotter mantle as it rises beneath spreading centers. Maximum inferred melt volumes are found on aseismic ridges directly above the central rising cores of mantle plumes, and average 20 +/- 1 and 18 +/- 1 km for seismic profiles and rare earth element inversions respectively. Both seismic measurements and rare earth element inversions show evidence for variable local crustal thinning beneath fracture zones, though some basalts recovered from fracture zones are indistinguishable geochemically from those generated on normal ridge segments away from fracture zones. This is consistent with a model where the melt generated beneath spreading ridges is redistributed to intrusive centers along the ridge axis, from where it may flow laterally along the axis at crustal or surface levels. The melt may sometimes flow into the bathymetric lows associated with fracture zones. Oceanic crust created at very slow-spreading ridges, and in regions adjacent to some continental margins where rifting was initially very slow, exhibits anomalously thin crust from seismic measurements and unusually small amounts of melt generation from rare earth element inversions. We attribute the decreased mantle melting on very slow-spreading ridges to the conductive heat loss that enables the mantle to cool as it rises beneath the rift.}

For the Southeast Indian Ridge abyssal plains, sediment thickness contours from Geli et al. (2007) were used. The new regional minimum sediment thickness grid was combined with the global National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) sediment grid to create an updated global grid.

  abstract = {The thermal evolution of planetary crust and lithosphere is largely governed by the rate of heat transfer by conduction. The governing physical properties are thermal diffusivity (kappa) and conductivity (k = kapparhoC(P)), where rho denotes density and C(P) denotes specific heat capacity at constant pressure. Although for crustal rocks both kappa and k decrease above ambient temperature, most thermal models of the Earth's lithosphere assume constant values for kappa ( approximately 1 mm(2) s(-1)) and/or k ( approximately 3 to 5 W m(-1) K(-1)) owing to the large experimental uncertainties associated with conventional contact methods at high temperatures. Recent advances in laser-flash analysis permit accurate (+/-2 per cent) measurements on minerals and rocks to geologically relevant temperatures. Here we provide data from laser-flash analysis for three different crustal rock types, showing that kappa strongly decreases from 1.5-2.5 mm(2) s(-1) at ambient conditions, approaching 0.5 mm(2) s(-1) at mid-crustal temperatures. The latter value is approximately half that commonly assumed, and hot middle to lower crust is therefore a much more effective thermal insulator than previously thought. Above the quartz alpha-beta phase transition, crustal kappa is nearly independent of temperature, and similar to that of mantle materials. Calculated values of k indicate that its negative dependence on temperature is smaller than that of kappa, owing to the increase of C(P) with increasing temperature, but k also diminishes by 50 per cent from the surface to the quartz alpha-beta transition. We present models of lithospheric thermal evolution during continental collision and demonstrate that the temperature dependence of kappa and C(P) leads to positive feedback between strain heating in shear zones and more efficient thermal insulation, removing the requirement for unusually high radiogenic heat production to achieve crustal melting temperatures. Positive feedback between heating, increased thermal insulation and partial melting is predicted to occur in many tectonic settings, and in both the crust and the mantle, facilitating crustal reworking and planetary differentiation.},

This was tested using the SEDSIM 3-D stratigraphic forward-modelling program, varying nine input variables in a synthetic example. Ten SEDSIM simulations were generated, with subtle differences in input, and five dip sections (fences) were displayed for each simulation. A geoscientist ranked the lithological distribution in order of sirnilarity to the true sections (the true input values were not disclosed during the experiment). The two or three highest ranked simulations then acted as seed for the next round of ten simulations, which were compared in turn. After 90 simulations a satisfactory match between the target and the model was found and the experiment was terminated. Subsequent analysis showed that the estimated input values were 'close' to the true values.},

Here we constrain the thermal history of the Southwest African plateau since 300 Ma by using apatite fission track (AFT) and (U-Th-Sm)/He (AHe) thermochronology. Archean rocks from the center of the Kaapvaal Craton yield AFT ages of 331.0 {\textpm} 11.0 and 379.0 {\textpm} 23.0 Ma and mean track lengths (MTLs) of 11.9 {\textpm} 0.2 and 12.5 {\textpm} 0.3 {$\mu$}m. Toward the southwest margin of the craton and in the adjacent Paleozoic mobile belt, AFT ages are significantly younger and range from 58.9 {\textpm} 5.9 to 128.7 {\textpm} 6.3 Ma and have longer MTLs ({$>$}13 {$\mu$}m). The range of sample AHe ages complements the AFT ages, and single-grain AHe ages for most samples are highly dispersed. Results from joint inverse modeling of these data reveal that the center of the craton has resided at near-surface temperatures ({$<$}60{$^\circ$}C) since 300 Ma, whereas the margins of the craton and the off-craton mobile belt experienced two discrete episodes of cooling during the Cretaceous. An Early Cretaceous cooling episode is ascribed to regional denudation following continental breakup. Late Cretaceous cooling occurs regionally but is locally variable and may be a result of a complex interaction between mantle-driven uplift and the tectonic setting of the craton margin. Across the entire plateau, samples are predicted to have remained at near-surface temperatures throughout the Cenozoic, suggesting minimal denudation ({$<$}1 km) and relative tectonic stability of the plateau.},

  abstract = {For the problem of predicting one-dimensional heat transfer between conducting and radiating mediums by an implicit finite difference method, four different formulations were used to approximate the surface radiation boundary condition while retaining an implicit formulation for the interior temperature nodes. These formulations are an explicit boundary condition, a linearized boundary condition, an iterative boundary condition, and a semi-iterative boundary method. The results of these methods in predicting surface temperature on the space shuttle orbiter thermal protection system model under a variety of heating rates were compared. The iterative technique caused the surface temperature to be bounded at each step. While the linearized and explicit methods were generally more efficient, the iterative and semi-iterative techniques provided a realistic surface temperature response without requiring step size control techniques.}

  abstract = {The Otway Basin of southeastern Australia rifted from Antarctica in two distinct stages in the Early Cretaceous. The first stage began around 140 Ma and ended between 110 and 120 Ma and formed an onshore rift; the rift faults typically detached within basement and were oriented between east-west and east-northeast. On the Crayfish Platform, these first-stage rift structures are preserved. The second stage of rifting at about 95 Ma, just prior to sea-floor spreading, had fault trends between east-southeast and southeast. It was less extensive in area, and the zone of highest extension was localized near the junction with oceanic crust. Geohistory and tectonic analyses indicate that both stages of rifting affected the whole southern margin. In the west, however, the first rift began at about 160 Ma, and first-stage trends persisted during the second rift.},

It is, however, one of the least well-constrained important geophysical parameters, with current estimates for end-member iron under core-mantle boundary conditions varying by about a factor of 6. Here, the current state of calculations, measurements, and inferences that constrain thermal conductivity at core conditions are reviewed. The applicability of the Wiedemann-Franz law, commonly used to convert electrical resistivity data to thermal conductivity data, is probed: Here, whether the constant of proportionality, the Lorenz number, is constant at extreme conditions is of vital importance. Electron-electron inelastic scattering and increases in Fermi-liquid-like behavior may cause uncertainties in thermal conductivities derived from both first-principles-associated calculations and electrical conductivity measurements. Additional uncertainties include the role of alloying constituents and local magnetic moments of iron in modulating the thermal conductivity. Thus, uncertainties in thermal conductivity remain pervasive, and hence a broad range of core heat flows and inner core ages appear to remain plausible.},

  abstract = {The Stawell Zone is interpreted to be part of the eastern extension of the Adelaide Fold Belt into Victoria. The Cambro-Ordovician turbidite sequence of the Stawell and Glenelg zones rests on a pile of Late Proterozoic metavolcanic rocks, rather than Cambrian metavolcanic units that are characteristic of the Lachlan Fold Belt. Early deformation events, D (sub 1) -D (sub 3) , in the Stawell Zone pre-date granite emplacement and were synchronous with regional fold-forming events that accompany thrust movements along discrete detachment surfaces. The thrust system follows a NE-SE-trending strike, with an E-directed translation of the tectonic units. The steep ( nearly equal 60 degrees ) predominantly W-dipping thrusts represent high-strain zones localised in relatively weak Cambro-Ordovician quartz-rich turbidites, that are sandwiched along the boundaries of the Late Proterozoic metavolcanics. Overprinting the early thrust system are D (sub 4) -D (sub 6) deformation events that include reverse, strike-slip and normal faults. The Grampians extensional basin, overlying the Late Proterozoic to Ordovician sequence, records a significant change in the tectonic regime operating during the Late Silurian-Early Devonian. It has been subjected to a Middle Devonian compressional deformation event, D (sub 4) , with the development of thrust and fold structures. This deformation is also superimposed on the thrusted and folded (D (sub 1) to D (sub 3) ) sequence to the east of the Grampians half-graben, producing further thrusts. A gradual change from a NE-SW to a N-S stress field produces oblique strike-slip faults. Normal faults of probably Early Cretaceous age transect the entire sequence. The Proterozoic-Cambrian sequence has been affected by a low-P/high-T, mid-greenschist facies regional metamorphic event. Peak-metamorphic conditions have been inferred from metavolcanic rocks and mafic units; derived from a strongly differentiated tholeiitic suite at Stawell. These have been calculated to be 1.7+ or -0.7 (2sigma ) kbar and 450+ or -20 (2sigma ) degrees C. The advective heat input necessary to create this low-P/high-T metamorphic event is attributed to penetrative deformation and strain partitioning between the crust and the mantle lithosphere which in turn causes crustal thickening, associated compression, and the observed D (sub 1) to D (sub 3) structures on the surface.},

  pages = {20--34},
  abstract = {The acoustic properties of most crustal rocks are dominated by microcracks, pores, and the fluids contained within them. Dry rocks have much lower elastic moduli than do any of the constituent minerals. They are acoustically much more non-linear (stress-dependent) than other common materials. Fluid-saturated rocks exhibit attenuation and velocity dispersion that is not observed in dry rocks. All of these effects, and others, have been ascribed to the complex nature of the crack/pore structure of rocks, and to the behavior of fluids occupying and flowing within the pore structure. Our intention here is to provide a concise status report on the present state of knowledge of rock acoustics. Several excellent review volumes have been published [12, 19, 59, 80, 84, 88, 92], and should be consulted for additional information. Our approach will be to present experimental results that illustrate specific aspects of rock acoustics, and show how theoretical models help us understand the observations. Several field applications will also be discussed. Since velocities in rock have been studied more extensively than has attenuation, some sections contain little or no reference to attenuation. AGU Reference Shelf 3 2. POROSITY Acoustic well-logs are frequently used to estimate porosity, especially in clean, water-saturated sandstones. This is based on an observation made by Wyllie et al. [103] showing that in clay-free, water-saturated sandstones under high-confining pressure, compressional-wave slowness (l/velocity) has a strong linear correlation with porosity. They proposed the equation-I * Vp V[ V m (1) where Vp is the compressional wave velocity in the rock, Vt-is the velocity in pore fluid, and Vm is the velocity in the solid matrix. Equation (1) is known as the 'time-average' equation, because the total travel time is the average of the times that a hypothetical linear raypath would spend in the fluid and in the matrix. It is, however, a correlation and not a rigorous theoretical model. Figure 1 shows an example from Gregory [31] where Equation (1) is compared to a suite of sandstone data. Significant amounts of clay in the rock will lower the velocity from the time-average prediction and recent work has attempted to derive correlations to both porosity and clay content (see Section 3).},

  abstract = {Ultrasonic velocity and attenuation measurements were made on dry, brine- and oil-saturated Berea sandstone and fused glass beads. The results for fused glass beads are consistent with the predictions of Biot theory. They indicate that as predicted, the Biot absorption/dispersion mechanism shifts to higher frequencies as the fluid viscosity increases. Similar data for Berea sandstone are not consistent with Biot theory, since observed velocities are generally higher than predicted. Using the Biot theory, we calculate low- and high-frequency velocities for the liquid-saturated samples. "Biot dispersion" is then defined as the percent difference between the low- and high-frequency limits. "Apparent dispersion" is defined as the percent difference between the measured ultrasonic velocity and the low-frequency Biot limit. Compari- son of these two measures of dispersion gives insight into the presence of a non-Biot absorp- tion/dispersion mechanism. Whenever the apparent dispersion is larger than the Biot dispersion, the extra dispersion is interpreted as being caused by a local flow relaxation. To be consistent with attenu- ation data, this relaxation must be distributed over at least five to six decades in frequency.},

  abstract = {Fluids entering the subduction zone play a key role in the subduction process. They cause changes in the dynamics and thermal structure of the subduction zone1, and trigger earthquakes when released from the subducting plate during metamorphism2,3. Fluids are delivered to the subduction zone by the oceanic crust and also enter the oceanic plate as it bends downwards at the plate boundary. However, the amount of fluids entering subduction zones is not matched by that leaving through volcanic emissions 4 or transfer to the deep mantle2, implying possible storage of fluids in the crust. Here we use magnetotelluric data to map the entire hydration and dehydration cycle of the Costa Rican subduction zone to 120 km depth. Along the incoming plate bend, we detect a conductivity anomaly that we interpret as sea water penetrating down extensional faults and cracks into the upper mantle. Along the subducting plate interface we document the dehydration of sediments, the crust and mantle. We identify an accumulation of fluids at {$\sim$}20-30 km depth at a distance of 30 km seaward from the volcanic arc. Comparison with other subduction zones5-14 indicates that such fluid accumulation is a global phenomenon. Although we are unable to test whether these fluid reservoirs grow with time, we suggest that they can account for some of the missing outflow of fluid at subduction zones. {\copyright} 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

  abstract = {We ran numerical experiments of the extension of a crustal wedge as an approximation to extension in an orogenic belt or a continental margin. We study the effects of the strength of the lower crust and of a weak mid-crustal shear zone on the resulting extension styles. A weak mid-crustal shear zone effectively decouples upper crustal extension from lower crustal flow. Without the mid-crustal shear zone, the degree of coupling between the upper and the lower crust increases and extension of the whole crust tends to focus on the thickest part of the wedge. We identify three distinct modes of extension determined by the strength of the lower crust, which are characterized by 1) localized, asymmetric crustal exhumation in a single massif when the lower crust is weak, 2) the formation of rolling-hinge normal faults and the exhumation of lower crust in multiple core complexes with an intermediate strength lower crust, and 3) distributed domino faulting over the weak mid-crustal shear zone when the lower crust is strong. A frictionally stronger mid-crustal shear zone does not change the overall model behaviors but extension occurred over multiple rolling-hinges. The 3 modes of extension share characteristics similar to geological models proposed to explain the formation of metamorphic core complexes: 1) the crustal flow model for the weak lower crust, 2) the rolling-hinge and crustal flow models when the lower crust is intermediate and 3) the flexural uplift model when the lower crust is strong. Finally we show that the intensity of decoupling between the far field extension and lower crustal flow driven by the regional pressure gradient in the wedge control the overall style of extension in the models.},

  abstract = {Export coefficient models (ECMs) are often used to predict nutrient sources and sinks in watersheds because ECMs can flexibly incorporate processes and have minimal data requirements. However, ECMs do not quantify uncertainties in model structure, parameters, or predictions; nor do they account for spatial and temporal variability in land characteristics, weather, and management practices. We applied Bayesian hierarchical methods to address these problems in ECMs used to predict nitrate concentration in streams. We compared four model formulations, a basic ECM and three models with additional terms to represent competing hypotheses about the sources of error in ECMs and about spatial and temporal variability of coefficients: an ADditive Error Model (ADEM), a SpatioTemporal Parameter Model (STPM), and a Dynamic Parameter Model (DPM). The DPM incorporates a first-order random walk to represent spatial correlation among parameters and a dynamic linear model to accommodate temporal correlation. We tested the modeling approach in a proof of concept using watershed characteristics and nitrate export measurements from watersheds in the Coastal Plain physiographic province of the Chesapeake Bay drainage. Among the four models, the DPM was the best--it had the lowest mean error, explained the most variability (R2 = 0.99), had the narrowest prediction intervals, and provided the most effective tradeoff between fit complexity (its deviance information criterion, DIC, was 45.6 units lower than any other model, indicating overwhelming support for the DPM). The superiority of the DPM supports its underlying hypothesis that the main source of error in ECMs is their failure to account for parameter variability rather than structural error. Analysis of the fitted DPM coefficients for cropland export and instream retention revealed some of the factors controlling nitrate concentration: cropland nitrate exports were positively related to stream flow and watershed average slope, while instream nitrate retention was positively correlated with nitrate concentration. By quantifying spatial and temporal variability in sources and sinks, the DPM provides new information to better target management actions to the most effective times and places. Given the wide use of ECMs as research and management tools, our approach can be broadly applied in other watersheds and to other materials.}

  abstract = {East Asia and South America have both experienced long-term subduction since at least the Jurassic, but they have had contrasting tectonic evolutions since the Late Cretaceous. East Asia was dominated by extensional tectonics with many marginal sea basins forming during the Cenozoic while South America was dominated by compressional tectonics building the Andean mountains. The mechanism controlling this contrast in tectonic style on opposite sides of the Pacific has been unclear. We suggest that the deep mantle flow revealed by seismic tomography, plate reconstructions, and geodynamic models contributed to the pan-Pacific tectonic disparity. Our geodynamic models suggest that the Atlantic Ocean opening plays an important role in promoting compression-dominated tectonics and Andean building along the South American margin by allowing fast trench-ward motion of South America. On the other hand, the long-standing downwelling flow beneath the interior of Asia since Asian assembly in the Paleozoic and the early Mesozoic helps to inhibit Atlantic-type ocean opening in Asia and restrain trench-ward motion of East Asia, promoting extension-dominated tectonics along the Asian margin. The restrained trench-ward motion suggests a low probability of flat-slab subduction occurrence in East Asia during the late Mesozoic.},

  abstract = {The particle-in-cell finite element (PIC-FE) method has been widely used in geodynamic numerical modelling due to its efficiency in dealing with large deformations without the requirement of remeshing. However, material deformation within a Eulerian mesh frame will mix particles of contrasting strength properties (e.g., viscosity in Stokes problems) in a single element requiring some form of averaging to project particle properties to inte\- gration points. The numerical solutions are thus dependent on the way how the particle properties are projected to the integration points. An intra-element property discontinuity may introduce severe stress oscillations along the interfaces. In this study, we assess three preprocessing methods to smooth the viscosity contrast within one element. For simplified models with analytical solutions, the accuracy and convergence rate in L2 norm are systematically studied with ensembles. It is found that using higher-order quadrature elements does not improve the convergence rate for either the velocity or stress solution, both close to one. Additionally, the convergence rate of the maximum stress error, which exists adjacent to the mixed-material elements, is much less than one for all cases studied here. Comparing each component of the stress tensor, we find that the stress tensor component with the highest strain rate gradient across the material interface produces the maximum stress error. Such errors can be reduced by averaging the particle properties to the Gaussian quadrature point with an inverse-distanceweighted harmonic mean.},

  abstract = {Northeast Asia underwent widespread rifting and magmatic events during the Cenozoic. The geodynamic origins of these tectonic events are often linked to Pacific plate subduction beneath Northeast Asia. However, the Japan Sea did not open until the late Oligocene, tens of millions of years after Pacific Plate subduction initiation in the Paleocene. Moreover, it is still not clear why the Baikal Rift Zone extension rate increased significantly after the late Miocene, while the Japan Sea opening ceased at the same time. Geodynamic models suggest these enigmatic events are related to the rapidly-aging Pacific Plate at the trench after Izanagi--Pacific spreading ridge subduction. Subduction of the young Pacific Plate delayed the Japan Sea opening during the Eocene while advection of the old Pacific Plate towards the trench increases seafloor age rapidly, allowing the Japan Sea to open after the early Miocene. The Japan Sea opening promotes fast trench retreat and slab stagnation, with subduction-induced wedge zone convection gradually increasing its extent during this process. The active rifting center associated with wedge zone convection upwelling also shifts inland-ward during slab stagnation, preventing further Japan Sea spreading while promoting the Baikal Rift Zone extension. Our geodynamic model provides a good explanation for the temporal-spatial patterns of the Cenozoic tectonic and magmatic events in Northeast Asia.},

We investigate the possible origin of along-strike geometric variations of the fault using a three-dimensional thermomechanical model. For two blocks separated by transpressional faults, our model shows that viscous lower crustal material moves from the high-viscosity block into the low-viscosity block. Fault plane-normal flow in the viscous lower crust rotates the fault plane due to the simple shear flow at the brittle-ductile transition depth. This occurs irrespective of initial fault dip direction. Rheological variations used to model the lower crust of Southern California are verified by independent observations. Block extrusion due to lower crustal viscosity variation facilitates the formation of the Garlock Fault and sustains the geometric complexity of the fault.},

Numerical results indicate that salinity variation throughout the basin has an important influence on fluid migration and the thermal regime. The spatial and temporal distribution of saline fluids can either promote or impede free convection. Relatively saline conditions (10 wt.\%) at the basin floor favour free convection; whereas, high salinities at depth suppress the development of convective hydrothermal systems. When salinity increases with depth, a higher geothermal gradient is required to induce and maintain significant fluid circulation. The implication is that sedimentary-exhalative ore deposits are more easily formed when evaporation first produces surface brines, and then these brines sink and displace pore waters in the basin.},

However, the widespread Cenozoic intraplate volcanism in northeast China1--3 and the young petit-spot volcanoes4--7 offshore of the Japan Trench cannot readily be associated with any of these mechanisms. In addition, the mantle beneath these types of volcanism is characterized by zones of anomalously low seismic velocity above and below the transition zone8--12 (a mantle level located at depths between 410 and 660 kilometres). A comprehensive interpretation of these phenomena is lacking. Here we show that most (or possibly all) of the intraplate and petit-spot volcanism and low-velocity zones around the Japanese subduction zone can be explained by the Cenozoic interaction of the subducting Pacific slab with a hydrous mantle transition zone. Numerical modelling indicates that 0.2 to 0.3 weight per cent of water dissolved in mantle minerals that are driven out from the transition zone in response to subduction and retreat of a tectonic plate is sufficient to reproduce the observations. This suggests that a critical amount of water may have accumulated in the transition zone around this subduction zone, as well as in others of the Tethyan tectonic belt13 that are characterized by intraplate or petit-spot volcanism and low-velocity zones in the underlying mantle.}

  abstract = {Abstract             Visco-elastic-plastic modeling approaches for long-term tectonic deformation assume that co-seismic fault displacement can be integrated over 1000s--10,000s years (tens of earthquake cycles) with the appropriate failure law, and that short-timescale fluctuations in the stress field due to individual earthquakes have no effect on long-term behavior. Models of the earthquake rupture process generally assume that the tectonic (long-range) stress field or kinematic boundary conditions are steady over the course of multiple earthquake cycles. This study is aimed to fill the gap between long-term and short-term deformations by modeling earthquake cycles with the rate-and-state frictional (RSF) relationship in Navier-Stokes equations. We reproduce benchmarks at the earthquake timescale to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. We then discuss how these high-resolution models degrade if the time-step cannot capture the rupture process accurately and, from this, infer when it is important to consider coupling of the two timescales and the level of accuracy required. To build upon these benchmarks, we undertake a generic study of a thrust fault in the crust with a prescribed geometry. It is found that lower crustal rheology affects the periodic time of characteristic earthquake cycles and the inter-seismic, free-surface deformation rate. In particular, the relaxation of the surface of a cratonic region (with a relatively strong lower crust) has a characteristic double-peaked uplift profile that persists for thousands of years after a major slip event. This pattern might be diagnostic of active faults in cratonic regions.           ,              Plain Language Summary             The numerical modeling method for long-term tectonic deformations averages out the co-seismic fault displacement into thousands to tens of thousands of years, and neglects near-fault damages of earthquakes; therefore, it may not be able to decipher fault activities in detail. Software simulating earthquake rupture dynamics may not have a good estimation of background stress due to long-term tectonic deformations. In this study, we develop a numerical framework that embeds earthquake rupture dynamics into a long-term tectonic deformation model by adding inertial terms and using highly adaptive time-stepping that can capture deformation at plate-motion rates as well as individual earthquakes. The inertia term, which is neglected in long-term large-scale modeling methods, is considered to simulate the dynamic rupture processes. The rate-and-state frictional relationship for co-seismic fault slip is implemented in viscoelastic-plastic earth. Benchmarks of viscous flow, viscoelastic wave propagation and earthquake cycle simulations are tested. Based on these benchmarks, we undertake a generic study of a thrust fault in crust. We find that lower crustal rheology affects the periodic time of characteristic large earthquake cycles and the inter-seismic free surface movement. Cratons with a relatively strong lower crust due to lower temperature remain two peaks in surface uplift profiles around the fault zone for thousands of years after one characteristic earthquake, which help identify active faults in cratons.           ,              Key Points                                                                We build code modeling earthquake cycles based on the long-term tectonic modeling software Underworld                                                     Benchmarks at the earthquake timescale are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach                                                     Cratons may remain two peaks in surface uplift profiles near the active fault for {$>$}1000~years after one characteristic earthquake},

We generate synthetic global topography fields with different power spectral slopes and spatial patterns to investigate how well the long-wavelength (spherical degrees 1 to 3) components can be recovered from a discrete set of samples where residual topography has been recently estimated. An analysis of synthetic topography, along with observed geoid and gravity anomalies, demonstrates the reliability of signal recovery. Appropriate damping factors, which depend on the maximum degree in the spherical harmonic expansion that is used to fit the samples, must be applied to recover the long-wavelength topography correctly; large damping factors smooth the model excessively and suppress residual topography amplitude and power spectra unrealistically. Recovered long-wavelength residual topographies based on recent oceanic point-wise estimates with different spherical expansion degrees agree with each other and with the predicted dynamic topography from mantle flow models. The peak amplitude of the long-wavelength residual topography from oceanic observations is about 1 km, suggesting an important influence of large-scale deep mantle flow.},

The alternative is that the anelastic effects of increasing temperature may cause the observed drop in velocity along with a predicted increase in attenuation. We report the first measurements of surface wave attenuation within regional arrays of seismometers on the seafloor. Near the East Pacific Rise, there is much less attenuation than is predicted by models in which the velocity is controlled solely by the direct elastic and anelastic effects of changing temperature, suggesting that melt and water concentration do play an important role. There also is somewhat less attenuation than is found in global studies; we speculate that scattering from unresolved velocity heterogeneities contribute to the apparent attenuation in global studies. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Landscapes on Earth retain a record of the tectonic, environmental and climatic history under which they formed. Landscapes tend towards an equilibrium in which rivers attain a stable grade that balances the tectonic production of elevation and with hillslopes that attain a gradient steep enough to transport material to river channels. Equilibrium low-relief surfaces are typically found at low elevations, graded to sea level. However, there are many examples of high-elevation, low-relief surfaces, often referred to as relict landscapes, or as elevated peneplains. These do not grade to sea level and are typically interpreted as uplifted old landscapes, preserving former, more moderate tectonic conditions. Here we test this model of landscape evolution through digital topographic analysis of a set of purportedly relict landscapes on the southeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau, one of the most geographically complex, climatically varied and biologically diverse regions of the world. We find that, in contrast to theory, the purported surfaces are not consistent with progressive establishment of a new, steeper, river grade, and therefore they cannot necessarily be interpreted as a remnant of an old, low relief surface. We propose an alternative model, supported by numerical experiments, in which tectonic deformation has disrupted the regional river network, leaving remnants of it isolated and starved of drainage area and thus unable to balance tectonic uplift. The implication is that the state of low relief with low erosion rate is developing in situ, rather than preserving past erosional conditions.},

  abstract = {The thermal effects associated with emplacement of the Willard thrust sheet within the Idaho-Utah-Wyoming thrust belt have been numerically modeled. Fluid-inclusion studies and mineralogy, including illite crystallinity, narrowly limit choice of permissible thermal models. Permissible models have initial thermal gradients between about 30 degrees C/km and 35 degrees C/km and fluid pressures less than lithostatic pressure.Fluid inclusions were trapped in syntectonic veins within the basal part of the Willard thrust sheet and in cataclastically deformed basement within the footwall. Homogenization temperatures have a bimodal distribution in the Willard sheet with maxima at 180 degrees C and 260 degrees C and a unimodal distribution in the footwall with a maximum at 200 degrees C. These temperatures, along with fluid composition, determine fluid density and define isochores along which the fluids were trapped. Illite crystallinity and mineralogy record maximum temperatures in the range of 300 degrees C to 500 degrees C with somewhat lower maximum temperatures in the footwall.Thermal models for emplacement of the Willard sheet indicate that the hanging wall undergoes initial rapid cooling, but the footwall undergoes initial warming due to tectonic burial. Later both areas undergo approximately isothermal decompression as erosion proceeds. P-T paths for reasonable parameter values intersect the modal isochores and are consistent with mineralogy, as required for a permissible model. The thermal model provides a reasonable framework for understanding the thermal history of the Willard sheet. The models are sensitive to thrust-sheet thickness, initial heat flow, and thermal conductivity. The thermal models are relatively insensitive to erosion history for reasonable erosion rates and to redistribution of heat-producing elements for the low values typical of sedimentary rocks.},

Previous geodynamic studies of mantle flow suggested that the cratonic root is moderately mechanically coupled with the underlying mantle, and stable continental drift on Earth's timescales occurs when the effective viscosity contrast between the continental lithosphere and the underlying mantle is approximately 103. Both geodynamics and seismological studies indicate that mechanically weak mobile belts (i.e., orogenic or suture zones) that surround cratons may play a role in the longevity of the cratonic lithosphere over geologically long timescales (i.e., over 1,000 million years) because they act as a buffer region against the high-viscosity cratons. Low-viscosity asthenosphere, characterized by slow seismic velocities, reduces the basal drag force acting on the cratonic root, which may also contribute to the longevity of the cratonic lithosphere.},

In response to these challenges, we developed a two-stage hierarchical, transdimensional, Bayesian scheme for inverting surface wave dispersion information for a 3D shear velocity structure and apply it to ambient seismic noise data recorded in Tasmania, southeast Australia. The key advantages of our Bayesian approach are that the number and distribution of model parameters are implicitly controlled by the data and that the standard deviation of the data noise is treated as an unknown in the inversion. Furthermore, the use of Bayesian inference --- which combines prior model information and observed data to quantify the a posteriori probability distribution --- means that model uncertainty information can b...},

The initial temperature cannot be too high or too low in order to realize the present-day thermal state, such as the surface heat flow and the inner core size. Two constraints have been placed: {\v Z}1. The age of the core is 4.4 = 109 years, comprised of periods of liquid phase and liquid--solid phase, {\v Z}2. the present-day heat flow is 4.4 = 1013 W at the Earth's surface. Global energy balance equations for a parameterized convection model are solved to obtain the initial temperature that satisfies the constraints. The model includes the effect of the inner core growth as well as partial layering of mantle convection. The effect of the partial layering is taken into the model by assuming enhanced thermal conduction across the mid-mantle transition zone, with conductivity a K times as high as the background. The parameter b in the Nusselt--Rayleigh number relationship is also employed as an adjustable parameter.},

The model inconsistencies, which are at least partly due to the use of non-unique single-method data inversion, led us to the application of integrated lithospheric multi-method modelling. Our approach combines the interpretation of surface heat flow, gravity and topography (local isostasy) data in order to constrain the continental lithospheric thermal structure along five transects crossing the Western Carpathians from the Polish platform and the Bohemian Massif to the Pannonian Basin. The results indicate clear variations of the lithosphere thickness along the Western Carpathian orogen not only in NS direction but also in WE direction. The lithospheric thickness is found to be 90-120 km underneath the Bohemian Massif, 115-140 km beneath the Polish platform and 75-100 km beneath the Pannonian Basin. A thick lithosphere (up to 130-150 km) is indicated underneath the central and eastern segments of the Western Carpathians with a tendency of thickening eastwards. This structure is interpreted as a remnant of a subducted slab of the European plate. In contrast, no lithospheric root shows up in our models of the westernmost segment of the Western Carpathians. We suggest that this difference indicates that in the transition zone from the Eastern Alps to the Carpathians, strike-slip movements predominated during the entire convergence period and no clear slab was produced in this area. {\copyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

It also plays an important role in recycling crustal material back into the mantle via possible continental deep subduction. The Banda Arc--Australian continent collision currently taking place in SE Asia is one of the most classic examples of such process, yet its detailed deep structure that is critical to our understanding on how it evolves is still unclear due to the previous lack of dense data coverage. Resulting from a new seismic experiment consisting of 30 seismometers across the collisional zone and utilizing three complementing imaging techniques, we detect direct structural evidence of the underthrusted Australian passive margin at lithospheric depths with different components (continental crust, lithospheric mantle, and their boundary) beneath the Timor island.           ,              Key Points                                                                Australian continental margin is detected beneath Timor by passive seismic imaging with new broadband data along the Banda Arc                                                     Across arc structural variations in the crust reveal the collision of the Australian continent with the Banda forearc terrane                                                     The progressive structural changes along strike reflect different collisional stages as a result of oblique plate convergence},

  abstract = {Understanding the dominant force responsible for supercontinent breakup is crucial for establishing Earth's geodynamic evolution that includes supercontinent cycles and plate tectonics. Conventionally, two forces have been considered: the push by mantle plumes from the sub-continental mantle which is called the active force for breakup, and the dragging force from oceanic subduction retreat which is called the passive force for breakup. However, the relative importance of these two forces is unclear. Here we model the supercontinent breakup coupled with global mantle convection in order to address this question. Our global model features a spherical harmonic degree-2 structure, which includes a major subduction girdle and two large upwelling (superplume) systems. Based on this global mantle structure, we examine the distribution of extensional stress applied to the supercontinent by both sub-supercontinent mantle upwellings and subduction retreat at the supercontinent peripheral. Our results show that: (1) at the center half of the supercontinent, plume push stress is {$\sim$}3 times larger than the stress induced by subduction retreat; (2) an average hot anomaly of no higher than 50 K beneath the supercontinent can produce a push force strong enough to cause the initialization of supercontinent breakup; (3) the extensional stress induced by subduction retreat concentrates on a {$\sim$}600 km wide zone on the boundary of the supercontinent, but has far less impact to the interior of the supercontinent. We therefore conclude that although circum-supercontinent subduction retreat assists supercontinent breakup, sub-supercontinent mantle upwelling is the essential force.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The Indonesia-Australia-New Guinea collision zone comprises a complex system of tectonic blocks whose relative motion accommodates convergence of the Sunda Block, Pacific, Australian, and Philippine Sea plates. Previous studies have considered either the western or eastern ends of this system, in eastern Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, respectively. However, these studies had limited ability to characterize either the kinematics of the central part of the system or transitions in tectonic regime across it. In this study, we perform a simultaneous inversion of 492 earthquake slip vectors and 267 GPS velocities to quantify the block movement spanning the Sunda-Banda Arc, Western New Guinea, and Papua New Guinea. Our best-fitting kinematic block model comprises 23 elastic blocks, for which we estimate the rotation rates and block boundary slip rates. We show how the Cenderawasih Bay sphenochasm was likely formed by a combination of both rotations (2.82~{\textpm}~0.11{$^\circ$}/Myr anticlockwise) of the Bird's Head Block and southwest-directed convergence (39.9~{\textpm}~1.7~mm/yr) along the Lowlands fault. Our estimated relative slip vectors across the New Guinea Fold-and-Thrust Belt indicate a transition in the tectonic regime of the block boundary from predominately thrust faulting at its western segment, with a convergence rate up to 19.5~{\textpm}~0.6~mm/yr, to predominately sinistral motion in the center segment with slip rate {$\sim$}7~mm/yr, and returning to thrust in the eastern segment with a convergence rate up to 9.0~{\textpm}~0.5~mm/yr, implying the combined effect of multiple driving mechanisms.           ,              Plain Language Summary             The Indonesia--Australia--New Guinea collision zone is an east-west elongated belt of complex tectonics at the northern edge of the Australian Plate, where the northward movement of the Australian continental lithosphere is accommodated by relative movement among a series of ``microplates'' in Indonesia and New Guinea. The interactions among these plates span the full gamut of tectonic phenomena. In this study, we use GPS measurements of crustal motion and earthquake data to estimate the motion of the tectonic units (plates and microplates) within the collision zone. While previous studies have considered either the western or eastern parts of this collision zone in isolation, in this study we consider together all the blocks spanning the zone from west to east. We show that this provides greater insight into changes in the tectonic regime through the center of the collision zone, and allows us to establish a new model for the development of the Cenderewasih Embayment in north-central New Guinea.           ,              Key Points                                                                A new broad-scale kinematic model has been developed spanning the 5,000~km length of the Indonesia-Australia-New Guinea collision zone                                                     The evolution of Cenderawasih Bay is based on the joint effect of the rotation of the Bird's Head block and the WSW drift of Weyland Thrust                                                     The New Guinea Fold-and-Thrust Belt experiences two transitions in its tectonic regime, as it traverses the center of the collision zone},

Twelve plume-like, continuous low-velocity (low-V) anomalies in both the upper and lower mantle are visible under Hawaii, Tahiti, Louisville, Iceland, Cape Verde, Reunion, Kerguelen, Amsterdam, Afar, Eifel, Hainan, and Cobb hotspots, suggesting that they may be 12 whole-mantle plumes originating from the core--mantle boundary (CMB). Clear upper-mantle low-V anomalies are visible under Easter, Azores, Vema, East Australia, and Erebus hotspots, which may be 5 upper-mantle plumes. A mid-mantle plume may exist under the San Felix hotspot. The active intra-plate volcanoes in Northeast Asia (e.g., Changbai, Wudalianchi, etc.) are related to the stagnant Pacific slab in the mantle transition zone. The Tengchong volcano in Southwest China is related to the subduction of the Burma microplate under the Eurasian plate. Although low-V anomalies are generally visible in some depth range in the mantle under other hotspots, their plume features are not clear, and their origins are still unknown. The 12 whole-mantle plumes show tilted images, suggesting that plumes are not fixed in the mantle but can be deflected by the mantle flow. In most cases, the seismic images under the hotspots are complex, particularly around the mantle transition zone. A thin low-V layer is visible right beneath the 660-km discontinuity under some hotspots, while under a few other hotspots, low-V anomalies spread laterally just above the 660-km discontinuity. These may reflect ponding of plume materials in the top part of the lower mantle or the bottom of the upper mantle. The variety of behaviors of the low-V anomalies under hotspots reflects strong lateral variations in temperature and viscosity of the mantle, which control the generation and ascending of mantle plumes as well as the flow pattern of mantle convection.},

  abstract = {A new global tomography approach has been used to study the deep structure and dynamics of hotspots and mantle plumes. In this approach, depth variations of the Moho, 410 and 660 km discontinuities are considered, the Earth structure is expressed by seismic velocities at grid nodes instead of blocks, and ray paths and travel times are calculated with a 3-D ray tracing technique. Prominent plume-like slow anomalies are detected under major hotspot regions from the crust down to the core--mantle boundary (CMB). Hotspots in Hawaii, Iceland, South Pacific and East Africa are located above slow anomalies in the lower mantle down to the CMB, suggesting that the mantle plumes under those hotspots may originate from the CMB. However, there may be some small-scaled, weak plumes originating from the transition zone or middle mantle depths. The slow anomalies under hotspots usually do not show a vertical pillar shape, which suggests that plumes are not fixed in the mantle but can be deflected by the mantle flow. As a consequence, hotspots are not fixed but can wander on the Earth's surface, as evidenced by recent geomagnetic and numerical modeling studies.}

  abstract = {Concentrated strain within plate margins and a significant toroidal component in global plate motion are among the most fundamental features of plate tectonics. A significant proportion of strain in plate margins is accommodated through motion on major tectonic faults. The decoupling influence of faulted plate margins primarily results from history-dependent lithospheric deformation rather than from instantaneous stress-weakening rheologies. For instantaneous mantle flow models, we argue that faults should be treated as preexisting mechanical structures. With models incorporating preexisting faults, a power law rheology with an exponent of 3, and slab pull and ridge push forces, we demonstrate that nonlinear interaction between weak faults and this power law rheology produces plate-like motion. Our models show that in order to produce plate-like motion, the frictional stress on faults needs to be small and the asthenosphere viscosity should be much weaker than that of lithosphere. While both plateness and the ratio of toroidal to poloidal velocities are reduced with increasing fault coupling, the viscosity contrast between the lithosphere and asthenosphere only influences plateness. This shows that both diagnostics, plateness and the ratio of toroidal to poloidal velocities, are necessary to characterize plate motion. The models demonstrate that weak transform faults can guide plate motion. This guiding property of transform faults and the decoupling of thrust faults result in oblique subduction where the strike of subducted slabs is oblique to transform faults. Subducted slabs beneath a dipping fault produce oceanic trench and fore bulge topography and principal stresses consistent with subduction zone observations.},

The momentum equation is the most computationally intensive portion of this coupled system because of its strongly nonlinear, elliptical character. We review the various discretization methods, ranging from finite differences to finite elements, which have been employed. We present in detail finite-element implementations of the Uzawa algorithm for the momentum equation and of the streamline Petrov--Galerkin algorithm for the energy equation. We review the application of modern techniques such as the Schur complement solvers and least-squares commutator preconditioners in the solution of the elliptical equation. We discuss the computational libraries available for massively parallel simulation and their application to this system of equations and give a preview of approaches suitable for exascale computing, which is a major challenge for the decade ahead.},

We have forced our model with the ICE-3G deglaciation history of Tushingham \& Peltier to study the effects of laterally varying lithospheric thickness on observations of post-glacial rebound (PGR). The laterally varying lithospheric thicknesses are derived from estimates of the thermal structure of the oceanic lithosphere and from elastic thicknesses on continents as estimated from studies of long-term geological loads. Our calculations show that the effects of lithospheric structure on the relative sea level change (RSLC) depend on the locations of the observation sites and on the size of loads. The RSLC at the centre of the North American ice sheet is significantly less sensitive to lithospheric thickness, compared with the RSLC at the centre of the Fennoscandian ice sheet. At the peripheral bulges the RSLC tends to be more sensitive to lithospheric thickness. The RSLC is controlled by local lithospheric thickness. The RSLC at a given location, as predicted using models with laterally varying lithospheric thickness, can be reproduced using a 1-D model with a uniform lithospheric thickness equal to the local lithospheric thickness. Coupled with efficient parallel computing, we believe that the finite-element model that we present here can be used to address a variety of viscoelastic deformation problems in geodynamics.},

The Priority-Flood algorithm uses a priority queue to process cells. This study proposes an efficient variant of the Priority-Flood algorithm, which considerably reduces the number of cells processed by the priority queue by using region-growing procedures to process the majority of cells not within depressions or flat regions. We present three implementations of the proposed variant: two-pass implementation, one-pass implementation and direct implementation. Experiments are conducted on thirty DEMs with a resolution of 3m. All three implementations run faster than existing variants of the algorithm for all tested DEMs. The one-pass implementation runs the fastest and the average speed-up over the fastest existing variant is 44.6\%.},

To overcome this defect, the refraction law is fully introduced into the numerical manifold method (NMM) as an a posteriori condition. To achieve a better accuracy of the Darcy velocity and continuous nodal velocity, a high-order weight function with a continuous nodal gradient is adopted. NMM is an advanced method with two independent cover systems, which can easily solve both continuous and discontinuous problems in a unified form. Moreover, a regular mathematical mesh, independent of the physical domain, is used in the NMM model. Compared to the conforming mesh of other numerical methods, it is more efficient and flexible. A number of numerical examples were simulated by the new NMM model, comparing the results with the original NMM model and the analytical solutions. Thereby, it is proven that the proposed method is accurate, efficient, and robust for modeling Darcy flow in heterogeneous porous media, while the refraction law is satisfied rigorously.},

  abstract = {Quantifying past mantle dynamic processes represents a major challenge in understanding the temporal evolution of the solid earth. Mantle convection modeling with data assimilation is one of the most powerful tools to investigate the dynamics of plate subduction and mantle convection. Although various data assimilation methods, both forward and inverse, have been created, these methods all have limitations in their capabilities to represent the real earth. Pure forward models tend to miss important mantle structures due to the incorrect initial condition and thus may lead to incorrect mantle evolution. In contrast, pure tomography-based models cannot effectively resolve the fine slab structure and would fail to predict important subduction-zone dynamic processes. Here we propose a hybrid data assimilation approach that combines the unique power of the sequential and adjoint algorithms, which can properly capture the detailed evolution of the downgoing slab and the tomographically constrained mantle structures, respectively. We apply this new method to reconstructing mantle dynamics below the western U.S. while considering large lateral viscosity variations. By comparing this result with those from several existing data assimilation methods, we demonstrate that the hybrid modeling approach recovers the realistic 4-D mantle dynamics the best.},

  abstract = {We use adjoint tomography to iteratively determine seismic models of the crust and upper mantle beneath the European continent and the North Atlantic Ocean. Three-component seismograms from 190 earthquakes recorded by 745 seismographic stations are employed in the inversion. Crustal model EPcrust combined with mantle model S362ANI comprise the 3-D starting model, EU00. Before the structural inversion, earthquake source parameters, for example, centroid moment tensors and locations, are reinverted based on global 3-D Green's functions and Frechet derivatives. This study consists of three stages. In stage one, frequency-dependent phase differences between observed and simulated seismograms are used to constrain radially anisotropic wave speed variations. In stage two, frequency-dependent phase and amplitude measurements are combined to simultaneously constrain elastic wave speeds and anelastic attenuation. In these two stages, long-period surface waves and short-period body waves are combined to simultaneously constrain shallow and deep structures. In stage three, frequency-dependent phase and amplitude anomalies of three-component surface waves are used to simultaneously constrain radial and azimuthal anisotropy. After this three-stage inversion, we obtain a new seismic model of the European curst and upper mantle, named EU60. Improvements in misfits and histograms in both phase and amplitude help us to validate this three-stage inversion strategy. Long-wavelength elastic wave speed variations in model EU60 compare favourably with previous body- and surface wave tomographic models. Some hitherto unidentified features, such as the Adria microplate, naturally emerge from the smooth starting model. Subducting slabs, slab detachments, ancient suture zones, continental rifts and backarc basins are well resolved in model EU60. We find an anticorrelation between shear wave speed and anelastic attenuation at depths {\textbackslash}textless 100 km. At greater depths, this anticorrelation becomes relatively weak, in agreement with previous global attenuation studies. Furthermore, enhanced attenuation is observed within the mantle transition zone beneath the North Atlantic Ocean. Consistent with typical radial anisotropy in 1-D reference models, the European continent is dominated by features with a radially anisotropic parameter \{xi\} {\textbackslash}textgreater 1, indicating predominantly horizontal flow within the upper mantle. In addition, subduction zones, such as the Apennines and Hellenic arcs, are characterized by vertical flow with \{xi\} {\textbackslash}textless 1 at depths greater than 150 km. We find that the direction of the fast anisotropic axis is closely tied to the tectonic evolution of the region. Averaged radial peak-to-peak anisotropic strength profiles identify distinct brittle-ductile deformation in lithospheric strength beneath oceans and continents. Finally, we use the point-spread function' to assess image quality and analyse trade-offs between different model parameters.},

As a result of these factors, the brittle crust is stronger than it would be under near-lithostatic pore pressure conditions. This result provides a constraint on models of lithospheric deformation. Postulating that the upper and lower crust and lithospheric mantle are totally coupled and that the total strength of the lithosphere is equal to the magnitude of tectonic driving forces ({$\sim$} 3 {\texttimes} 1012 N m-1), we have calculated lithospheric strain rates under representative thermal and theological conditions such that the integrated differential stress over the entire thickness of the lithosphere equals the plate driving force. For a strike-slip stress state and surface heat flow of 60 {\textpm} 6 mW m-2, average strain rates are approximately 10-18 s-1 under hydrostatic upper crustal pore pressure conditions, and approximately 10-15 s-1 under near-lithostatic pore pressures. The latter strain rates are higher than either observed geodetically using very long baseline interferometry (VLBI), or estimated on the basis of plate tectonic reconstructions. Hence we argue that hydrostatic upper crustal pore pressures enable lithospheric plates to behave rigidly over time scales of tens to hundreds of millions of years. {\copyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract = {Analytical solutions are provided for the two- and three-dimensional advection--diffusion equation with spatially variable velocity and diffusion coefficients. We assume that the velocity component is proportional to the distance and that the diffusion coefficient is proportional to the square of the corresponding velocity component. There is a simple transformation which reduces the spatially variable equation to a constant coefficient problem for which there are available a large number of known analytical solutions for general initial and boundary conditions. These solutions are also solutions to the spatially variable advection--diffusion equation. The special form of the spatial coefficients has practical relevance and for divergent free flow represent corner or straining flow. Unlike many other analytical solutions, we use the transformation to obtain solutions of the spatially variable coefficient advection--diffusion equation in two and three dimensions. The analytical solutions, which are simple to evaluate, can be used to validate numerical models for solving the advection--diffusion equation with spatially variable coefficients. For numerical schemes which cannot handle flow stagnation points, we provide analytical solution to the spatially variable coefficient advection--diffusion equation for two-dimensional corner flow which contains an impermeable flow boundary. The impermeable flow boundary coincides with a streamline along which the fluid velocity is finite but the concentration vanishes. This example is useful for validating numerical schemes designed to predict transport around a curved boundary.},

  abstract = {Numerical simulations of seismic wave propagation in heterogeneous 3D media are central to investigating subsurface structures and understanding earthquake processes, yet are computationally expensive for large problems. This is particularly problematic for full waveform inversion, which typically involves numerous runs of the forward process. In machine learning there has been considerable recent work in the area of operator learning, with a new class of models called neural operators allowing for data-driven solutions to partial differential equations. Recent works in seismology have shown that when neural operators are adequately trained, they can significantly shorten the compute time for wave propagation. However, the memory required for the 3D time domain equations may be prohibitive. In this study, we show that these limitations can be overcome by solving the wave equations in the frequency domain, also known as the Helmholtz equations, since the solutions for a set of frequencies can be determined in parallel. The 3D Helmholtz neural operator is 40 times more memory-efficient than an equivalent time-domain version. We employ a U-shaped neural operator for 2D and 3D elastic wave modeling, achieving two orders of magnitude acceleration compared to a baseline spectral element method. The neural operator accurately generalizes to variable velocity structures and can be evaluated on denser input meshes than used in the training simulations. We also show that when solving for wavefields strictly on the surface, the accuracy can be significantly improved via a graph neural operator layer. In leveraging automatic differentiation, the proposed method can serve as an alternative to the adjoint-state approach for 3D full-waveform inversion, reducing the computation time by a factor of 350.},

  abstract = {Abstract             How seismotectonics of convergent margins reconciles with the force balance of subduction is contentious. The comparison of seismotectonics and available slab pull forces along the Sunda convergent margin shows an enigmatic inverse relationship: upper plate thickening and seismicity magnitude are highest along Sumatra and Andaman, where the slab is shorter than {$\sim$}300~km; conversely, these are negligible along the Java segment, where the slab reaches deeper, {$\sim$}660~km. Using numerical models, we test the role of such slab pull gradients in the force balance of subduction in three-dimensions, where the slab depth, and therefore its net pull, varies along the trench. We show that in the presence of a ``slab step,'' the deeper slab drives the convergence of the rigid plate, causing upper plate compression and trench advance in the neighboring trench segments, where a short slab may have no pull to subduct the incoming plate. While neglecting convergence obliquity, the simplified models show relevant along-trench variations of coupling, trench rotations, and minor strike-slip shearing due to the slab step, providing a diagnostic strain pattern, with compression/extension atop the short/long slab and minor strike-slip, increasing in magnitude with depth difference. The modeled tectonic patterns are compared to Sunda margin deformation across scales, from the Cenozoic tectonics to the seismic strain rates, showing remarkable consistency with deformation gradients from Sumatra to Java, potentially illustrating the contribution of the slab step to the seismotectonics of the region.           ,              Key Points                                                                Sunda margin thickening and seismic strain are anti-correlated with the slab depth and largest in the proximity of a step in the slab depths between Sumatra and Java                                                     Numerical models of subduction with slab steps show compatible upper plate tectonics and trench motions due to deep slab lateral loading                                                     Strain regimes and seismicity along the Sumatra-Java margin support the role of trench-parallel tectonic loading across timescales},
