#### READ BEFORE YOU RUN THIS CODE

This example only compiles/runs on the petsc branch 'knepley/feature-plex-examples'.

The branch is available via the docker-compose file 'knep-compose.yaml' located at the root of this project.
To run the correct branch via docker-compose:
  docker-compose -f knep-compose.yaml' up

The model is a static 2D stokes solve in an annulus geometry using free slip boundary conditions. A heavy sinker (circular geometry) drives the flow.
